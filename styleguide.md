*I have been advised [by a friend](http://audaciousfox.com/style-guide/) that the best way to bring consistency to my writing is by following a style guide. This guide is almost a direct rip-off of Kyle's guide.*

### Premise
Language evolves each day, and weaving in and around these changes is difficult to do. This document will serve as The Newsprint's unique style guide and will evolve over time.

### Basic Rules
- [Title capitalization.](http://titlecapitalization.com)
- [Comma use.](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/owlprint/607/)
- Oxford comma: *This, that, and the other thing.*
- Possessive plural: Attach a single apostrophe: *The Olympus' lens is sharp.*
- Colons: Capitalize the first letter of a complete sentence after a colon.
- *"A couple of weeks ago"* becomes *"A couple weeks ago"*.
- *"The monthly budget that I created"* becomes *"The monthly budget I created"*.
