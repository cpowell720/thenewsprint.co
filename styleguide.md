*I have been advised [by a friend](http://audaciousfox.com/style-guide/) that the best way to bring consistency to my writing is by following a style guide. This guide is almost a direct rip-off of Kyle's guide.*

### Premise
This document will serve as The Newsprint's unique style guide and will evolve over time.

### Rules

- Possessive plural: Attach a single apostrophe: *The Olympus' lens is sharp.*
- Colons: Capitalize the first letter of a complete sentence after a colon.
- *"A couple of weeks ago"* becomes *"A couple weeks ago"*.
