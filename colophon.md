The Newsprint was founded and is written by Josh Ginter. The Newsprint is a web-column where I collect things. I have many interests and I really want talk about and photograph all of them.

### Tools

The Newsprint is written primarily on a MacBook Pro and iPad Air 2.

The Newsprint is photographed with an Olympus OM-D E-M10 accompanied by Panasonic Lumix 20mm f/1.7 and Olympus 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 lenses.

The Newsprint is managed on the Jekyll platform and is hosted at Github Pages.

The Newsprint's custom design was created by [Josiah Wiebe](http://jwie.be).
