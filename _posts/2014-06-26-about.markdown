## Colophon

The Newsprint was founded and is written by [Josh Ginter](http://joshuaginter.com). The Newsprint is a web-column where I collect things. I have many interests and I really want talk about and photograph all of them.

### Tools

The Newsprint is written primarily on a MacBook Pro.

The Newsprint is photographed with an Olympus OM-D E-M10 accompanied by Panasonic Lumix 20mm f/1.7 or Olympus 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 lenses. 

The Newsprint is managed on the Ghost platform and uses the Readium 2.0 theme by [Sven Read](http://www.svenread.com).
