Tools & Toys published my [review of the Twelve South BookBook for iPhone 6 Plus](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/bookbook-case-iphone-6-plus/) today. 

This was a fun review to shoot as I tried out a new setup for the first time. You may have seen the general layout already here on The Newsprint, but the BookBook review was actually the first product shot with the white backdrop. Although this isn’t a softbox, it gives a more minimal feel and puts the product on display in a far better manner than anything I’ve previously shot.

As far as the BookBook itself goes — I love it. The case on its own would be far too big to handle on a daily basis, but being able to slide the rubber case out of the leather shell saves the bacon. And eliminating extra everyday carry items is always a bonus.

As always, head over to Tools & Toys to check out the review.
