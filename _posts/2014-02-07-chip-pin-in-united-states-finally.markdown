title: Chip and PIN Credit Cards (Finally) Coming to the US

<p>Much like the weird <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/68/">Fahrenheit debate</a>, Americans have yet to accept Chip-and-PIN debit and credit cards. The added convenience of swiping and signing does not - <em>can not</em> - outweigh the benefits of added security. I find the amount of time it has taken for the United States to accept the Chip-and-PIN card to be astounding, especially considering the massively pervasive NSA scandals.</p>

<p>On another note, I'm interested to see how breakthrough payment system companies like <a href="https://onlycoin.com/">Coin</a> and <a href="https://squareup.com/ca">Square</a> deal with the October 2015 change. They have oodles of time to adapt their products to the new payment system, but I am curious as to how they adapt. </p>

<p>It'll be a <a href="http://recode.net/2014/01/30/paypal-wants-in-on-apples-mobile-payments-dreams/">fun</a> year and a half in the payment system arena.</p>
