As always, Steve is super positive about the E-M5 II. He loves it.
 
I’m hearing early on that, although specifications aren’t drastically different, there’s a level of polish to this camera that puts it over the top. It’s Olympus’ version of the iPhone 5S – launch a product, find the faults, and fix the problems for the next iteration. Little nitpicks, like the placement of the On/Off switch, the default Super Control Panel setting, and the swivel LCD all show that Olympus has been listening to its customers over the past few years.
 
That’s why I’m so excited after reading early impressions. Not a whole lot could be improved on the original Olympus E-M5, so Olympus found the things that annoyed its customers and fixed them. This sounds like Olympus has taken its customers seriously — something too many companies get wrong.
