<blockquote>
  <p><em>This is truly a nightmare scenario for any CEO: do you take the risk and proceed with the better user experience/product at the expense of short term numbers–with no promise that the better design will actually lead to long-term benefits–or do you scrap the new design and start over? The answer to this question is where company culture and identity dramatically peek through the curtain and express themselves in very raw form. Because it is impossible to answer this question rationally–both sides can be argued very successfully–it has to be answered from a cultural point of view.</em></p>

<p>At some level, I believe this happens with <em>every</em> business. Facebook's numbers are just really, really big. Like really, really big. </p>

<p>Companies would kill to have the problems Facebook runs into on a daily basis. But it's really cool to see the implications of following big data.</p>

<p>As always from Mr. Curtis, a great read.</p>
