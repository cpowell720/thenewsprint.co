I had a BookBook case for my iPhone 5 and I loved it. Eliminating an extra item from my everyday carry was just one of the great aspects of that BookBook case. 

I've been waiting to see what TwelveSouth would churn out of the labs for the 6 and 6 Plus. Lots of people will be worried about the size of a wallet that encompasses the 6 Plus, but I'm willing to bet it'll be just as handy as the case for the iPhone 5. 

It also looks like my biggest complaints have been addressed with the new BookBook case, namely the ability to quickly remove the iPhone from the wallet. Moreover, the 6 Plus BookBook's added size should fit our slightly larger Canadian currency much better than the smaller iPhone 5/5S BookBook. 

This new BookBook looks like a winner to me and has skyrocketed to the top of my Christmas wish list.
