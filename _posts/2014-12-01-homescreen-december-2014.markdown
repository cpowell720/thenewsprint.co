Another month, another couple homescreen shots. Here's where I'm at heading into the Christmas season.

I've added a few apps for work purposes, namely Yahoo! Finance, Microsoft Exce, and Slack. 

Yahoo! Finance is the only stock market app I've found that fits me at this point in time. Any Bloomberg apps or paid choices seem to be above and beyond my needs. If you're looking for a simple way to keep track of the ups and downs of the market, and to read some applicable news, Yahoo! Finance is a good choice.

Microsoft Excel on my iPhone is just plain awesome. I'm one of those numbers guys who uses Microsoft Excel all day, every day. Now, with the ability to make edits and create simple spreadsheets for free, Microsoft Excel on my iPhone has changed my ability to do work on the go.

Lastly, I've finally had the opportunity to try out Slack. It's every bit deserving of the recognition it gets. I'm thinking about getting my boss to implement Slack at the firm for the New Year. There really doesn't seem to be a better way to communicate with a team. 

Other than that, the biggest changes are returns of Reeder and VSCO Cam now that they have both been updated for the iPhone 6 screen sizes.

Next up, my iPad.

I've got five new additions to my iPad for this month.

Again, Yahoo! Finance, Microsoft Excel, and Slack have joined the foray for work purposes. While Microsoft Excel is a great addition to my iPhone workflow, it's an even better addition to my iPad. Now, if something comes up in the evening that needs to be edited, I can make the change on my iPad instead of needing to drive back to the office. Needless to say, I couldn't be happier with Microsoft's opening up of their free Office apps.

I've also added Overcast to my homescreen now that it has become a universal app. I really like the extra wide split-view menu in lanscape orientation. The whole app has a very unique feel and works as smooth as butter.

And finally, Vainglory. I jumped aboard the bandwagon about a week and a half ago and I can't put this game down. It's the first game that has hit my homescreen in a very long time and it's too addicting to put anywhere else. Maybe the Vainglory fad has passed for the time being, but you can be sure you'll find me playing a few matches each and every evening.

This is going to be a very fun month here on the blog. The first anniversary of the blog is just two short weeks away and I've got a few nice surprises to announce in the time being. This Homescreen post is a nice way to start off what's going to be an exciting month.
