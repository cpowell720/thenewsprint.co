<p>Although you may have ventured into the Chronodex tab when visiting Patrick Ng's <a href="http://scription.typepad.com/blog/">personal site</a> from <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//patrick-ngs-midori-travelers-notebook">Tuesday</a>, I figured his weekly planner system was worth a second look.</p>

<p>When developing a personal planner system, Patrick strayed away from the linear format most planners adhere to. Instead, using a creative stroke of genius, Patrick devised a circular system that looks a lot like <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//the-daily-rind">The Daily Rind</a> from a few days ago. The flow of the day is the central point of the system and the beauty of the circle will make your planner look like a piece of art.</p>

<p>If you feel like it, you can actually download PDF versions of the Chronodex which can be stapled and put into your own planner. I think this is a really neat way of getting an idea out there. </p>

<p>You can be sure I'll try this system out after I pick up a Midori in the coming weeks. I'll let you know what I find.</p>
