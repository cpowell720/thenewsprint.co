I pointed out some terrifying photography a few weeks back in The Sunday Edition and those same crazy guys are back at it again.

Standing on top of skyscrapers hundreds of feet in the air, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaliy Raskalov [don't seem to understand boundaries or fear.](http://ontheroofs.com/cairo/) This time, they've taken a few day trips to Cairo, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. 

Just looking at these photos makes my spine tingle.
