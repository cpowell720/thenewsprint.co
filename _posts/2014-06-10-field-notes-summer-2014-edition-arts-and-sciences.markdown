[A definite step away](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/artsandsciences/) from the classic COLORS editions. I'm intrigued with the larger size, extra pages and the new innard rulings. Also, Summer 2014 comes in a two-pack rather than the classic three-pack.

I can't wait to get my hands on these. I'm curious to see if students can use these as a go-to notetaking book for class. Normal Field Notes books are just too small for heavy notetaking.
