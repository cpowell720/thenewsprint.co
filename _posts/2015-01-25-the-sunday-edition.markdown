The most difficult part about compiling The Sunday Edition each week is choosing whether to link to the article during the week or to include it on Sunday. Generally, if I have something extra to say, it gets linked during the week. If I think the article is awesome and agree 100% with the author’s work, it becomes part of The Sunday Edition.

But this week has been more difficult. Take, for example, Casey Liss’ “Ten Years” article. It’s a bit cliché, *but that’s the point*. There’s so much I want to say about my own wife after reading Casey’s piece, but realistically, no part of that conversation would be new for you. So voilà, The Sunday Edition it is.

As always, enjoy your afternoon cup of coffee with these awesome links.

***Editor's Note:** I've wanted a better way to share random photos I snap throughout the week. I figured I could include a photo or two in The Sunday Edition. I'll try to make them as unobtrusive as possible, seeing as this post is dedicated to the awesome work of other people. If you don't appreciate this element, please get in touch. I love hearing from you.*
