I remember [having](http://jwie.be/writing/launch-center-pro-daily-journaling/) the [discussion](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/reporter-day-one-and-launch-center-pro/) about [Day One](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/day-one-journal-notes-diary/id421706526?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v5At) and [Launch Center Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v5At) back in March. I've been using these templates to log my written notes and thoughts every day since then. 

So, as a result, it's really neat to see an archive of all these useful templates over on the Day One site. In particular, I'm excited to read through and adopt some of [MichaÃ«l le Gal's impressive Day One templates.](http://www.mickaellegal.com/blog/2014/3/31/day-one-launch-center-pro) 

If you're looking for a more quantified life and haven't adopted [Reporter](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/reporter-app/id779697486?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v5At), these Day One and Launch Center Pro templates are a good starting point.
