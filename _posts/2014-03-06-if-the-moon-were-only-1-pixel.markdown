<p>When scrolling through this "tediously accurate map of the Solar System", I couldn't help but admire the lengths that Josh Worth had to go to show the massiveness of our Solar System. Our Solar System <em>is huge</em> — we all know this — but to put it into a perspective like this makes my jaw drop. </p>

<p>I hope you have a half decent trackpad. Otherwise, the level of "tediousness" will skyrocket, pun intended.</p>
