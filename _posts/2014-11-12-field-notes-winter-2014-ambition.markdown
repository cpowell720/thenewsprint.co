I was a little [lukewarm](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/10/16/field-notes-unexposed/) about Field Notes Brand's 24th edition this fall. Unexposed seemed to rub me the wrong way. 

Like every good fairy tale, Unexposed appears to be just a blip on the radar. Field Notes Brand announced their 25th seasonal edition today. Named *Ambition*, this edition comes in three classic colours and is stuffed with gilded pages. Of further interest is the new Cougar Opaque paper inside Ambition, which I'm sure will be the talk of the analog-town over the next few weeks. Lastly, for the first time ever, Field Notes Brand has printed one grid book, one ledger book and one weekly calendar book for each Ambition three-pack. 

I'm intrigued. Upon first sighting, this appears to be the best Colors release yet. I bought a bunch to give as Christmas gifts to my friends and co-workers.

I can't wait for the mail to arrive.
