I typed the majority of my notes for my degree work. I saved the files in my Dropbox with appropriate folders, dates and titles. I scanned in PDFs and saved them within the appropriate course files. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But those text files are, in essence, transcriptions of lectures. In some cases, they are <em data-preserve-html-node="true">word for word</em> from the professor&#8217;s mouth.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> As a result, much of the info I typed was a complete waste. Deciphering what is useful in my mangled text files is the largest downfall of my digital notes system.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">After I graduated, I decided to take a different route and I began business studies at the local college. And, trying to learn from my mistakes, I made the decision to write my notes in a physical notebook.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Me being me, no ordinary notebook was sufficient. I had to find something better than the crappy looseleaf I used in high school.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Moleskine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My first encounter with a Moleskine product was during my honeymoon in New York. I&#8217;ve <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//on-my-desk-moleskine-light-metal-roller-pen">already written about</a> the beautiful Moleskine pen I picked up at the Columbus Circle kiosk but I haven&#8217;t discussed the other goodies I grabbed. Alongside the pen, I picked up a few <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/volant/">Volant notebooks</a> that introduced me to writing on high quality paper.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buttermoleskine.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I no longer write in my Volant notebooks as I made the mistake of buying the blank page variety. I need ruled pages.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> However, Volant notebooks are a <em data-preserve-html-node="true">dream</em> to write in. I found myself writing in those notebooks for the sake of writing. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Therefore, I jumped at the first opportunity to purchase another Moleskine book with proper ruled lines. The Extra Large Cahier fit my school needs perfectly.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Cahier</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/cahier/cahier-journal-set-of-3-pocket-ruled-soft-black-6891">Moleskine Extra Large Cahier</a> comes in five different colours and in ruled, full grid and blank paged varieties. They measure in at 7.5&#8220; wide by 10&#8221; long and have nicely rounded corners to boot. And, at 120 pages, the Cahiers are big enough to carry one course&#8217;s worth of notes and are thin enough to be conveniently carried in a messenger bag.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In fact, carrying these Cahiers is one of my favourite parts of the books. It&#8217;s not that they are thin or light, but rather that I can carry four or five of them without losing much space in my bag. I remember using binders full of looseleaf in high school and I dreaded having to pack multiple binders every morning. By using dedicated notebooks like the Cahier, I have eliminated much of the effort of carrying binders.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But if you come to the dedicated notebook party for the sake of classy Moleskine notebooks, you stay at the party for classy Moleskine paper. The innard paper is an off-white variety with grey ruled pages. The paper is more rigid than the paper found in old Hilroy notebooks used in elementary schools. This rigidity adds a very small amount of friction between Moleskine&#8217;s roller pens and the paper and I&#8217;ve come to like this specific pen-to-paper friction — the tactile feedback adds intimateness that is lost when writing in the Cahiers with a standard ballpoint pen.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thread.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Cahiers are stitch-bound instead of staple-bound. The stitching adds personality but slightly deteriorates the Cahier&#8217;s long-term durability. I have a few small Pocket Cahiers that are stitch-bound and, after extensive use, the stitches tend to rip. My Extra Large Cahiers are not put through the harsh environment of my back pocket, so I don&#8217;t mind the tradeoff of durability for extra personality and style.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Moleskine always promotes its inclusion of a pocket in the inside back cover. I&#8217;ve never liked Moleskine&#8217;s implementation, though; while the pockets do add nice utility, they fail miserably in durability. All my pockets are ripped and are unuseable. This isn&#8217;t a deal breaker for me as I don&#8217;t use pockets to begin with, but I can see it being frustrating for other people.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My last small nitpick with the Extra Large Cahier — or rather with Moleskine as a whole — is the drive for absolute minimalism in their notebooks. I admire minimalism as a principle, but my notebooks have accumulated to the point of needed organization. I need to document my books by adding information on the inside cover. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes Brand</a> has mastered the inside cover documentation. Moleskine prides itself in absolute minimalism and I admire their passion to adhere to the principle. However, if they were to release a less-minimal notebook with documentation printing on the inside, I would jump exuberantly.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/grainy.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">My favourite part of the decision to use dedicated notebooks for class is the experience of filing away my notes at the end of the semester. My bookshelf holds physical evidence of my business studies. I can look at my books and admire the information written inside. Despite the fact that I can&#8217;t type a search query in the search bar and find my exact notes within seconds, I am still able to discover who I was at that point. Whoever the person was who typed my digital notes in university is undiscoverable in the digital passages. Digital notes have zero personality. <em data-preserve-html-node="true">My</em> Cahiers are <em data-preserve-html-node="true">my</em> notes and there are morsels of <em data-preserve-html-node="true">me</em> inside. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And, like an education, that personality lasts a lifetime.</p>
