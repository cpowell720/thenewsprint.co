Oddly, despite the fascinating weather happening across the continent, we in Southern Manitoba — who are generally accustomed to hard, dry, cold winters — were hit with an unbelievably warm snap over the last few weeks. Temperatures hovered around 0 Celsius for almost two weeks and we even saw most of our snow melt away. This is *very* odd for our geographical region, so you can colour me keenly aware about what Mother Nature may have in store for us in the future. 

Normally these weekend reads are best suited beside a warm cup of coffee and a blanket. If, like us, you're finding it plenty warm already, I recommend skipping the blanket and reading these fine links. I'd recommend skipping the coffee, but we all know that's insanity.
