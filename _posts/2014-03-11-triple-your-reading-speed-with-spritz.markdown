<p>Although I'm unsure if this will gain widespread popularity, I love seeing how the application of big data and science can combine to make simple tasks even more simple. My only complaint about reading is that it generally takes too long. Spritz may fix that.</p>

<p>I had a hard time comprehending what I was reading at first, but when I let my mind get past the incredible pace of the words, I was able to quickly get through a large amount of text with perfect comprehension. Even my wife — a slow, thorough reader — was able to comprehend at 500 words per minute. </p>

<p>I can't imagine reading an entire novel with Spritz, but I know better than to say never. This could be really cool.</p>
