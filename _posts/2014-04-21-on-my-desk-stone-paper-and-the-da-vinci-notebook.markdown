<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img4.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Ever since I got my hands on a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/expedition/">Field Notes Expedition Edition</a> memo book, I&#8217;ve been intrigued with waterproof and highly durable papers. I&#8217;ve even gone so far as to design a book made of leather and waterproof paper for my own personal use. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">There are a couple different options to choose from if you&#8217;re looking for waterproof paper. Field Notes Expedition Editions are made of a waterproof and tear-resistant <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://yupousa.com">Yupo paper</a>. Expedition competes directly with <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.riteintherain.com">Rite in the Rain</a> memo books which are made of a patented waterproof paper. Both are known widely for their durability and waterproof characteristics. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Thanks to Nick Romer, a new competitor is about to enter this market. Nick sent me a sample piece of his new &#8220;Stone Paper&#8221; which is in the middle of an already-successful Kickstarter campaign. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Nick&#8217;s Stone Paper couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time. Throughout my tests, I continuously considered whether or not I would use Stone Paper in my theoretical memo book. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My eventual answer? I want two books made of both Yupo and Stone Paper. Or, better yet, a hybrid between the two. Is that too much to ask for?</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Stone Paper</h2><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img3.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Before getting started, I urge you to skim through Nick Romer&#8217;s <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/388011235/da-vinci-notebook">Kickstarter Campaign</a> for the Da Vinci Notebook. His campaign page is chalked full of interesting information regarding the fabrication of Stone Paper. Nick outlines the environmental aspect of Stone Paper and how little harm comes to the environment through the production process. The page also has a great video outlining many of Da Vinci Notebook&#8217;s other strengths and characteristics.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In short, Stone Paper is a unique form of synthetic paper that is made of calcium carbonate and resin. This unique combination is environmentally-friendly and can be made with little energy. Trees, bleach, and water have been eliminated from the manufacturing process and the process benefits from a significant reduction in energy consumption. In terms of the environment, Stone Paper leads the way.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The unique calcium carbonate and resin mixture lends a very thick and heavy final product. I liken the feeling to that of a &#8220;vinyl wrap&#8221; that can be found on mouldings in your home.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> Describing it is actually one of the most difficult writing assignments I&#8217;ve come across and I truly believe you need to feel the paper before understanding the idea behind the product. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Stone Paper is quite heavy. Nick only sent a single piece of Stone Paper for testing purposes and that single piece&#8217;s weight is surprising. I&#8217;m very curious about the size and heft of a full book of Stone Paper. I can&#8217;t imagine the book would go unnoticed in your back pocket.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The &#8220;vinyl&#8221; feeling is very soft to the touch and holds its shape extremely well. I attempted to fold a corner of the Stone Paper and found the fold slowly reforming its natural shape before too long. I also tore a corner of the Stone Paper to test its durability and, although more difficult to tear than standard 50 lb. paper, Stone Paper would not classify as &#8220;tear-resistant.&#8221; In fact, once torn, Stone Paper pulls apart fairly easily. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That soft touch feeling is of immense importance, especially when testing out different kinds of pens. A prior (and awesome) review of Stone Paper by <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://thatonepen.com/2014/04/07/stone-paper-da-vinci-notebook/"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">That One Pen</em></a> shows more pen tests than I can offer and I recommend heading over there to check out the results. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img2.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Overall, Stone Paper has a leg up on Yupo in the ink-acceptance category. My experiences with ballpoints and roller balls were positive. Fine ballpoints worked extremely well and I had no complaints with how the ink flowed onto the page.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Sharp pencils may be problematic for Stone Paper due to the softness of the paper; sharp edges dig in, especially when writing rounded parts of letters, and I found myself constantly having to rewrite the letter &#8220;O&#8221; after pressing hard. Flipping the paper over shows an embossing from the lines I drew with the pencil. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Writing on the Stone Paper with a roller ball was great. I used a Moleskine pen with two refills to test out roller balls. The 0.5mm refill, like the pencil, dug in here and there but was substantially smoother than writing with a sharp pencil. The 0.7mm refill, on the other hand, was the best writing experience of any pen I tried. The ink flowed beautifully onto the page and no sharp tips dug into the paper. The roller ball experience was nearly flawless.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">At least until testing out the &#8220;waterproofness&#8221; of Stone Paper.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img1.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">After trying out my pens, I left the room and let the inks sit for six hours. I returned to the room and tried splashing some water onto the page to see how the paper would hold up. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Stone Paper itself held up fine and dried as if nothing happened. But the inks sure didn&#8217;t. And this fully surprised me.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The ballpoint Jetstream ink held up well but feathered slightly more than the same tests with my Field Notes Expedition Edition Yupo paper. The same can be said for the Fisher Space Pen ballpoint ink. And easily the least affected medium was the mechanical pencil lead. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But my Moleskine roller ball inks nearly washed away <em data-preserve-html-node="true">completely</em>. Just splashing water on these inks caused them to greatly fade and the washed ink dyed the rest of the page. I couldn&#8217;t have been more surprised.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">After reading Brad Dowdy&#8217;s review of how different types of pens react to Yupo paper in the Field Notes Expedition Edition, I instantly hoped Stone Paper would solve many of the problems of waterproof paper. Yupo paper rejects all water based inks and they wipe away without water being splashed on the page. Stone Paper, in contrast, accepts the water based inks but the same result forms when water is splashed on the page. Stone Paper accepts inks better than Yupo but water renders this aspect useless. Yupo flat out rejects some types of ink but handles water better after it has been splashed. </p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Verdict</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">At the end of the day, I need to ask myself about whether or not I want to carry around a book made of Stone Paper instead of a book made out of Yupo. And I can&#8217;t help but want both.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Stone Paper is far superior in terms of mediums that can be used for writing. I tried ballpoints, roller balls, and pencils and I&#8217;ve read others who have tried gels, fountain inks, markers and crayons without any hindrance. Score one for Stone Paper.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Stone Paper is quite hefty and durable as well. Folding a corner didn&#8217;t result in much and a small tear test revealed the paper was more difficult to tear than standard 50 lb. paper. However, when compared to Yupo, which can hold <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/expedition/">six bricks at once without tearing</a>, the competition is steep. Score one for Yupo.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In terms of the environment, Stone Paper is an extremely friendly product. But Yupo isn&#8217;t made of wood either. I call this one a draw. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The biggest comparison chart needs to get wet to yield some real results. Stone Paper is the better option for dry writing, but inks don&#8217;t hold their own as well when wet. Ballpoint inks feathered and roller ball inks almost completely washed away. Wet Yupo can dry ballpoint inks almost perfectly, leaving only a small amount of ghosting on the opposite page of a spread. Score another for Yupo.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That leaves a score of 2&#8211;1 for Yupo. Perhaps comparing them isn&#8217;t fair, especially in terms of waterproofness. Stone Paper&#8217;s ability to accept all sorts of ink is what makes it a viable product and I expect to see Stone Paper around for a considerable amount of time.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now, can someone make a book that combines the benefits of Yupo and Stone Paper? That book would offer the best of both worlds and would be my ideal waterproof and high-durability notebook for work out in the wild. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This is, perhaps, an awkward way to describe what Stone Paper feels like. However, I worked on a lumber yard for a number of years and I found myself writing on all sorts of materials. The vinyl wrap on mouldings was the closest possible material I could compare to Stone Paper. I don&#8217;t recommend you go writing on your mouldings to experience the Stone Paper feeling, though. It would be a great idea to back the Kickstarter Campaign instead and feel the paper that way. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
