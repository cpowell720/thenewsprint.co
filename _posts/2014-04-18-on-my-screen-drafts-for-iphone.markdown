<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Drafts%20Notes.png" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Guess what? Despite all my harping about how well a pen and paper work for jotting down notes, there are times where they just don&#8217;t work. Period. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">To put it bluntly, pens and memo books suck for writing notes on-the-go. If a thought pops in my head while I&#8217;m driving — which seems to be the only scenario in which my brain kicks into gear — my pen and memo book become absolutely useless to me.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For scenarios like these, I need a good notetaking app on my iPhone. And there is certainly no shortage of choice.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But most importantly, my use-case is quite different than the average &#8220;note-funnel&#8221; app user. I find myself merely using a notetaking app as a holding zone until writing the note into my memo books. I find typing calendar events into Fantastical to be a far better experience than typing them into a funnel and then sharing the text. I also find typing in Byword far more enjoyable than typing in a bare app.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And I want something that uses Avenir.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In essence, my need for a digital note-taking app is very <em data-preserve-html-node="true">analog</em> in nature. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So what&#8217;s my digital note-taking app of choice? It has switched from <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scratch-your-quick-input-notepad/id533320655?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v5At">Scratch</a> to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vesper/id655895325?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v5At">Vesper</a> to Drafts to Scratch to Vesper to Drafts multiple times. Indeed, Drafts has become my app of choice. And all for one very small — and red — detail that would seem irrelevant to most people.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Drafts for iPhone</h2><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img5.png" /><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id502385074?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v5At">Drafts</a> is developed by <a href="http://agiletortoise.com">Greg Pierce</a>. Greg is singlehandedly responsible for developing the now widely used iOS URL scheme which allows apps to speak to each other in more direct ways. It has truly <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/">changed the way</a> we use our iOS devices today.</p>

<p>While Drafts’ implementation of URL schemes is incredible, I rarely find myself using the feature. In fact, I rarely find myself using <em>any</em> of Drafts’ great features. </p>

<p>What I need is a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> book on my iPhone. Not a funnel that shoots text all over Timbuktu. And not a blackhole that sucks all my notes into a place I never visit. </p>

<p>David Sparks <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2014/1/the-drafts-badge">wrote about an unheralded Drafts feature</a> a few months back:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I generally have a lot of animosity toward iOS app badges. I don’t like apps screaming for my attention. It diverts me from important things, like Strategery. However I was recently bemoaning my frequent problem in the Drafts app where I’ll dictate notes and forget to later process them. MPU listener Conrad pointed out there is a setting that gives the app a big red needy badge with the number of unprocessed notes in my Drafts App. This is an excellent use of a badge in my opinion and was exactly what I needed to make sure I didn’t leave unprocessed notes in Drafts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drafts’ little “Unread”/“Unprocessed” badge is a godsend amongst notetaking apps. </p>

<p>Drafts is not situated at the end of my notetaking process. Rather, it sits in a state of flux somewhere in the middle of my process. Sometimes Drafts gets used and sometimes it doesn’t. When it does get used, sometimes notes stay and sometimes they don’t. Drafts, for me, is fluid and non-concrete. </p>

<p>As a result, I <em>need</em> Drafts’ Unread badge. Since my notes are always in a state of flux, I need to know whether there is or is not text within Drafts’ perimeter. If there is a red badge, I know that I have to take my digital notes and write them into my memo book. If there isn’t a badge, I know my phone is an empty alley. Perfect.</p>

<p>Writing out notes twice may seem redundant but it has become essential to my workflow. As I mentioned earlier, I have used <em>many</em> different notetaking apps in the past. As I experimented with different apps, all my notes became fractured and dispersed in dark corners throughout my iPhone. This is far from ideal. I would rather write out my notes twice and have all my thoughts in one isolated place than have them scattered throughout my digital footprint.</p>

<p>Why Drafts and not Scratch or Vesper? I absolutely love Scratch. In my opinion, Scratch has the <em>most</em> beautiful icon on the App Store. It also has an awesome History tray that shows all your notes that are saved within the app.</p>

<p>I also love Vesper. Vesper uses gorgeous typography and incredible design to brighten your notes unlike any other notetaking app on the App Store. It even supports photos and tags, which are both incredible features for the majority of users.</p>

<p>But both don’t have that little red Unread badge. If they did, my quest to find the perfect notetaking app would return to its historical state of indecision.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img4.png" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I could sit here and write about Drafts&#8217; incredible URL scheme actions and its ability to communicate efficiently with rest of the apps on my iPhone. I could also sit here and write about its poor app icon or its lack of Mac companion. Or, better yet, I could talk about the iPad version.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But I just don&#8217;t care about those things. I care about that little annoying Unread badge.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">If an idea or a thought are unlucky enough to be born while I&#8217;m mobile and out of arms reach from a pen and/or memo book, I need an app that can quickly save a short snippet and remind me later in the day. The app doesn&#8217;t have to have URL schemes, alarms or incredible typography<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> to fulfill my needs. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">It just needs to <em data-preserve-html-node="true">not be</em> a black hole. It needs to take my ideas and put them into a format that can quickly be moulded into anything I need them to be. And I need to be reminded later in the day to actually mould them.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Drafts does this better than any other app I&#8217;ve come across. And it&#8217;s on my homescreen as a result.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Granted, a smartphone isn&#8217;t a better option while I&#8217;m driving either. However, I&#8217;m lucky enough to have a Bluetooth system that works seamlessly with my iPhone. I&#8217;m able to hold down the home button, bring up Siri, open an app and dictate my thoughts all by speaking through the car&#8217;s stereo system. I still have to press the &#8220;Dictation&#8221; button beside the spacebar on my iPhone, but this is a lot better than typing the note completely.
