<blockquote>
  <p><strong>3. Men lived in the trenches for years on end</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>Front-line trenches could be a terribly hostile place to live. Often wet, cold and exposed to the enemy, units would quickly lose their morale if they spent too much time in them.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>As a result, the British army rotated men in and out continuously. Between battles, a unit spent perhaps 10 days a month in the trench system, and of those, rarely more than three days right up on the front line. It was not unusual to be out of the line for a month.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>During moments of crisis, such as big offensives, the British could occasionally spend up to seven days on the front line but were far more often rotated out after just a day or two.</em></p>

<p>World War I was one of my favourite events to research (like <em>everybody</em> else) when completing my degree. </p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20, like always, and The Great War was the tragedy of tragedies. The horrors experienced in Europe at that time were unlike anything human beings had ever imagined. </p>

<p>Or were they?</p>

<p>It turns out that the <em>actual</em> severity of the Versailles Treaty is anticlimactic, especially considering an entire <em>second</em> world war was fought over the treaty.</p>

<p>Whether or not you are a historian, these 10 myths are worth a read.</p>
