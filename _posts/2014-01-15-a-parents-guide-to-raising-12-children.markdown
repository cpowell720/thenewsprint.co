<p>My wife's sister and her husband believe in a very structured routine for their two beautiful children. They insist on routine feeding schedules, routine nap schedules and a proper early morning wake up. But that's only one method of raising children and instilling life lessons along the way.</p>

<p>The couple in this article used much the same child-rearing methods, but they applied it to <strong>twelve</strong> children. All 12 children grew up in a structured household — with an <em>extremely</em> early breakfast each morning — and all 12 have gone on to achieve success.</p>

<p>It would be <em>very</em> wrong to look for correlation between a structured rearing and long-term monetary success. However, there is nothing better than learning what worked well for one set of parents. </p>

<p>My wife and I will learn via observation in the meantime. I'll be saving this article for future reference.</p>
