<p>Ram Dass:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Prior to my first experience with psychedelics, I had identified with that which dies – the ego. The ego is who I think I am. Now, I identify much more with who I really am – the Soul. As long as you identify with that which dies, there is always fear of death. What our ego fears is the cessation of its own existence. Although I didn’t know what form it would take after death – I realized that the essence of my Being – and the essence of my awareness – is beyond death.</em></p>

<p>Modern medicine and modern technology have allowed human beings to live longer than ever before. Life expectancy, as of 2011, is 78.64 years in the United States and 80.94 years in Canada. That is a substantial increase over the <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/health26-eng.htm">70 years of life expectancy</a> in the 1950s.</p>

<p>At what cost though? Are our lives being stretched out, like a rubber band, whereby the same quality of life is being extended over a longer amount of time? Or are the quality of life concentrations equal throughout the extended 80 years? Do I want to fill my small cup of water to the brim? Or should I take that water and pour it into a bigger cup?</p>

<p>I've never been good with death; I've never been good at giving sympathy or condolence. Some may view this as a weakness — a fault — of mine. Others may view it as a strength. But who cares?</p>

<p>The great Master Yoda says it best:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.</em></p>

<p><em>Dying is Absolutely Safe</em> is profoundly touching. Ram Dass explains that Death is not finality or the end, or even the beginning of something new. It's a natural transition, the spreading of wings, the most pure moment of Truth of which we should all embrace and learn.</p>

<p>Modern technology and modern medicine aim to <em>prolong</em> life, to prolong the inevitable <em>transition</em> of death. Technology has immensely improved my life, my productivity and the ways in which I interact with the world around me. But when it's my turn to die, I don't want a prolonging. I want that transition to be as pure and as truthful as possible. I'll be damned if I have an electrical cord keeping me alive. </p>

<p>Pull the plug. Let loose. Be alive. Or, embrace death. Why fear that which is inevitable?</p>
