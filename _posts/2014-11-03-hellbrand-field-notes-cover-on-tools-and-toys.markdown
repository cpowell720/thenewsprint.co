My brother made his modeling debut in this [Tools and Toys review of the Hellbrand Leather Field Notes Cover.](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/hellbrand-leather-field-notes-cover/) I really like how these photos turned out, especially the shots of his grubby hands.

The Hellbrand cover is one of my favourites. I've put it aside right now to test out the [DDC Stuff Sheath,](http://www.draplin.com/1998/01/ddc101_stuff_sheath_1.html) but there's no doubting the Hellbrand's timeless and durable design.
