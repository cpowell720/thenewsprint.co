<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Compass%201.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I bought an iPad mini when Apple first launched the smaller tablet format. I really liked the form factor; I found myself taking my iPad with me wherever I went and I used that iPad more than my phone. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But yet, I could never come to grips with the typing experience. All I ever did on the mini was read and consume.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So when the iPad Air came out with a decreased footprint and decreased weight, I had to have it. I would get (almost) the same portability as the mini and have a full screen keyboard for typing. The Air seemed like the best of both worlds.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But of course, the typing experience on the Air was hardly an improvement. Laying the iPad flat on its back promoted the worst posture I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I needed something that would prop up the screen for improved typing both on my desk and on the go.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Compass%202.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.twelvesouth.com/product/compass2">Twelve South Compass</a> fit my bill perfectly.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> It folds up into a portable package that can easily fit into any messenger bag and it offers multiple viewing angles when perched on a desk. It&#8217;s almost a perfect iPad stand.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My Compass has eliminated any need for my laptop on the go. If I have an excessive amount of typing to do, I can haul along my Apple keyboard, whip out my Compass stand and use the iPad as my ultra-portable computer. Reaching to touch the screen instead of using a trackpad is still something I have to get used to, but the Compass is sturdy enough to not buckle and move when I navigate.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I&#8217;ve had a few different iPad stands in the past that I never fell in love with. I realized why I never liked those stands as soon as I opened my Compass. The Compass rests the iPad in a perfect viewing angle for using alongside an external keyboard and an equally perfect angle when used in a typing orientation. If my stand holds my iPad at too steep or too shallow an angle, I experience that same terrible posture when I use the iPad laid flat on its back. The point of any stand is to improve usability and posture. Due to these perfect viewing angles, the Compass is my favourite iPad stand.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Compass%203.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I said &#8220;almost&#8221; perfect earlier because of a minor quibble. The two holders that fold out from the bottom of the two arms are too long. When in a typing position, I find these little &#8220;fingers&#8221; striking my palms more often than not and I end up bumping the stand. I&#8217;ve tried to deduce why the fingers are so long and I concluded it must be due to the Compass having been designed for the original 2010 iPad. The Compass 2 appears to have slightly shortened the length of these fingers, which should decrease the chances of bumping them. I would never encourage someone to replace their original Compass with a Compass 2 solely because of the finger length, however. It&#8217;s an easy nitpick to overcome.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">All my favourite tools have a certain <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/">element of &#8220;delight&#8221;</a> for me. My iPad delights me with its immersive and razor-sharp screen. My <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.booqbags.com/us/shoulder-bags/mamba-courier/MCR13-BLK">Booq messenger bag</a> delights me with incredible strap durability and surprising carry volume. My <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes memo books</a> have a nostalgic feel which enhances the emotion between pen and paper. And my Compass provides an elegant delight when propping up my iPad on the go. The Compass has a unique utility, both in form and function. It checks off every characteristic I want and need in an iPad stand and I don&#8217;t see myself ever advising people to buy something else.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I&#8217;ve tried <em data-preserve-html-node="true">many</em> Twelve South products and the Compass iPad stand is their best. If you use your iPad on the go in any way, the Compass is the best stand you can get. </p>
