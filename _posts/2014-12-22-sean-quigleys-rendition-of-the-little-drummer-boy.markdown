Christmas carols are plentiful on the radio these days. But whenever the Little Drummer Boy comes on, my heart skips a beat. 

The Little Drummer Boy isn't a classic hymn that my grandparents or great-grandparents would be particularly fond of, but it's a song that touches my heart in the most unique way possible. I'm not a musician of any kind, so the honour of playing in front of *any* deserving audience is something that escapes me. That said, I can only imagine the splendour in being smiled at by the person you aim to please your whole life. The power of that moment would be beyond any experience imaginable. 

My favourite rendition of this carol is done by a local Winnipeg musician. He played every instrument and sang every lyric in the song. And he captured the entire video wearing shorts in the snow. His video went viral a couple years ago, but his work has become a staple in my home ever since.

Here are the lyrics if, like me, you feel inclined to sing along:

> Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum; A new born King to see, pa rum pum pum pum; Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum; To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum;
> So to honor Him, pa rum pum pum pum; When we come.

> Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum; I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum; I have no gift to bring, pa rum pum pum pum; That's fit to give our King, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum;
> Shall I play for you, pa rum pum pum pum; On my drum.

> Mary nodded, pa rum pum pum pum; The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pum pum pum; I played my drum for Him, pa rum pum pum pum; I played my best for Him, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum;
> Then He smiled at me, pa rum pum pum pum; Me and my drum.
