My good friend Josiah [has grabbed the latest Launch Center Pro update and ran with it.](http://jwie.be/writing/launch-center-pro-updated/) 

[Josiah](jwie.be) is responsible for creating a new technique to log daily activities using [Launch Center Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v5At) and [Day One](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v5At). Even [Shawn Blanc wrote about Josiah's LCP actions](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/03/reporter-day-one-and-launch-center-pro/). 

After [LCP's 2.3 update](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/launch-center-pro-2-3-extends-ios-automation/), Josiah is back at it again. He just created a [simple LCP-IFTTT workflow](http://jwie.be/writing/launch-center-pro-updated/) whereby a photo is uploaded to Dropbox and then uploaded to your private Flickr feed. You can even give your photo a title, description and tags within Launch Center Pro. Super cool and super easy to use.

I recommend keeping tabs on Josiah's site for the foreseeable future. When he gots on a roll, he gets on a roll. I wouldn't be surprised to see him cook up a few more useful recipes by day's end.
