<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This whole <em data-preserve-html-node="true">Paper</em> <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://news.fiftythree.com/post/75486632209/every-story-has-a-name-fiftythrees-story-began">debacle</a> is a macrocosm of bullying. It&#8217;s not a case of emulation. Nor is it a case of flattery. It&#8217;s downright <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/makers-of-paper-app-ask-facebook-to-change-new-app-name/">theft</a>. Worst of all, the stealing of the name represents more than theft — it represents a threat to the innovative process as a whole.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Innovation&#8217;s greatest enemy is complacency. When a product or service does its job so well that it eliminates competitors, that product immediately becomes vulnerable to complacency. Why fix something that isn&#8217;t broken? </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But where does this complacency stem from? Startup companies with little corporate structure are the leading force of innovation. With few opinions and a less rigorous decision structure, startups are able to efficiently tackle cutting edge products and services.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> The inclusion of all major opinions, board members and shareholders into a corporate decision-making structure greatly hinders the chances of innovative ideas seeing the light of day.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This is why Facebook&#8217;s Paper<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> app is so detrimental to the system. Facebook represents the corporate-giant thief and Fiftythree represents the startup victim. Stealing Fiftythree&#8217;s trademarked name by simply using enormous size and spending power is an undermining of the startup/corporation innovation process. Paper by Fiftythree has been associated with breakthrough design and innovative programming. Now, that same name faces disillusionment. If an App Store venturer types in &#8220;Paper&#8221;, the once innovative application that changed design on the iPad will now be replaced with a corporate app that hogs your privacy.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> What gives?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In addition to the &#8220;story of the name&#8221;, what about dollar-speak? If huge money flows in the direction of the corporate monster who stole a name, does that not also undermine the innovation process? How can startups fund their brilliant ideas if investors know a giant can simply <em data-preserve-html-node="true">take</em> their brand?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Worst of all, Facebook has been in Fiftythree&#8217;s shoes <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/facebook-asserts-trademark-on-word-book-in-new-user-agreement/">in the past</a>. Facebook has tried to expand its trademark rights over the term &#8220;book&#8221; and has launched lawsuits against websites and companies who use the word. All the hypocracy aside, Facebook <em data-preserve-html-node="true">must</em> understand the implications of its now gigantic corporate power. Zuckerberg would have lost his mind had someone threatened his name in the early days of &#8220;The Facebook&#8221;. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And lastly, what precedent does this set for future startups who want to bring a brilliant idea to market? The fear — the bullying effect — instilled in this Facebook strategy will have a lasting impact on the market if something isn&#8217;t changed.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Facebook knows few startups have the power to stand up to its size and spending power. But to use that against a startup is hypocritical, detrimental and enormously consequential.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I suppose the fact that one is made for the iPad and the other made for the iPhone will play a role in an App Store search. However, the association of characteristics to a name or brand is of the utmost importance for marketers. In this case, it&#8217;s the thought that counts. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
