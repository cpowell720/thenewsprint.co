I wonder how many changes this list would need to undergo to fit today's state of affairs. Despite the reality of inequalities still today, women have greatly risen on the social scale since Darwin's time. 

Fortunately, there is a nice little correlation between Darwin's marriage question and today's marriage question: marriage is still a million times better than the friendship of a dog... anyhow.
