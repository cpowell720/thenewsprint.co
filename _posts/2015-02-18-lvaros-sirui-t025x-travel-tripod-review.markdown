Not very many reviews have me clicking the "Buy Now" button right away. This review touches on every nut, bolt, and screw of one of the best travel tripods money can buy. 

I had a chance to watch Álvaro work on this review from start to finish and I was incredibly impressed by his attention to detail. His long exposure shots are scintillating and his words are fine tuned and crisp. I'm almost embarrassed to put my work up next to his. 

I don't think you can top a tripod review like this. It's like the "tripod review to end all tripod reviews". And it'll certainly put an end to your tripod hunt if you're in the market for one.
