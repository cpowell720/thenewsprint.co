Over on Tools and Toys, I snapped [some photos and wrote a few words](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-compass-stand-for-ipad/) about the most versatile iPad stand money can buy. The TwelveSouth Compass Stand is super easy to throw in a bag and to take with you wherever you go.

If you're a little late on the Christmas shopping this year, the Compass Stand is an awesome stocking stuffer for an iPad owner.
