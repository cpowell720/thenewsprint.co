<p>If there is one piece of the flying experience that stinks, it's the paperwork. The horizontal boarding pass has <em>never</em> made sense. But, like the rest of the airline industry, things are <a href="http://gma.yahoo.com/faa-allow-gadgets-during-off-landing-152052983--abc-news-travel.html">slow to change</a>.</p>

<p>This vertical boarding pass, although still huge, is far better than the current horizontal offerings.  </p>
