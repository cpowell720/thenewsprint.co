There’s a new product reviewer in town. His name is Álvaro. His photographic genius and masterful prose are second to none. Even if you’re not in the market for an ultra-durable ruck sack, you should probably check out Álvaro’s work.
 
On a slight side note, Álvaro’s review is why I love being a part of the Tools & Toys contributing team. His incredible work pushes us all to take better photographs, to create better scenes, and to pen better thoughts and anecdotes. Not only are these beautiful reviews super fun to absorb, they are only going to get better as time goes on. 

Each review pushes the bar that much higher and presents new opportunities and ideas for the next. It's going to be fun to watch Tools & Toys over the foreseeable future.
