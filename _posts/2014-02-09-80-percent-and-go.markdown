<p>Gayle Allen:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>80% and go: lose the desire to be perfect. If you can get to perfect the first time, you’re probably not dreaming big enough. Give it 80%, get it out there, and get ready for feedback. It’s coming. It’s okay. Use it. Learn from it. That’s how you’ll get to 100%.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>I've always known that perfection is nearly impossible to achieve. Having said that, I have never started a project with the goal of achieving <em>less</em> than perfection.</p>

<p>Although this list of 12 pieces of advice is fairly well-known, you may find a few tidbits to inspire your next adventure. </p>
