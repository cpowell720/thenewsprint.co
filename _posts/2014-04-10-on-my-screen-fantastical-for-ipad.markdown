<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Lots of people use the car-vs-truck analogy to create context. A car is generally the better option for transporting individuals from Point A to Point B in the most efficient way. On the other hand, a truck is a better option for hauling material from Point A to Point B in the most powerful way. Each is best in its own environment. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Obviously this can be applied to digital and analog tools. I’ve come around on analog tools as of late and I love the satisfaction in using high quality pens and paper.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But iPads and iPhones are simply better than pens and paper for some things.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Newsprint is dedicated to finding the best tools and processes to increase productivity and work-satisfaction. I can’t continue the <em data-preserve-html-node="true">On My Desk</em> series with my back turned on digital. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So, as an addendum to <em data-preserve-html-node="true">On My Desk</em>, digital apps and digital work processes will be outlined in the <em data-preserve-html-node="true">On My Screen</em> series. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I’m not an expert on the ins and outs of code or design and there are a million people online who write software reviews. <em data-preserve-html-node="true">On My Screen</em> probably won’t deal with specifications whatsoever. Instead, <em data-preserve-html-node="true">On My Screen</em> will discuss how a specific app works into a workflow or how it has changed my productivity at some level. I’m not a software expert and I won’t pretend to be one. I am, however, an expert on <em data-preserve-html-node="true">me</em> and my processes — I’m allowed to discuss and review <em data-preserve-html-node="true">me</em> to my heart’s content. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And for me, the most effective digital tool is a digital calendar. I can’t stay even remotely organized without a digital calendar. I need something that can be altered easily and something that can be easily carried in my pocket. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Fantastical has changed how I use a digital calendar. And now it’s on my iPad. </p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Fantastical for iPad</h2><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/iPad%20Fantastical%20Dashboard.png" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">There are a thousand calendar apps on the iOS App Store. The best calendar apps have always been released for the iPhone and this is where I began my digital calendar workflow. I jumped from <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://savvyapps.com/agenda/">Agenda Calendar</a> to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.sunrise.am">Sunrise</a> to the stock iOS calendar app to Fantastical in a relatively short period of time. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v5At">Fantastical for iPhone</a> became my first choice after the testing period and, as a result, the iPhone became the only place where I would interact with my calendar. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I tried to adapt my calendar to all sorts of iPad apps as well. But they all eluded me. I never included my iPad in my calendar management. In fact, I never used my iPad for <em data-preserve-html-node="true">any</em> productive purposes; calendars, reminders, timers, alarms — you name it, nothing worked for me. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That was all until <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-ipad-calendar/id830708155?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v5At">Fantastical for iPad</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The funny thing is that I don&#8217;t care a lick about the really cool dashboard <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://flexibits.com">Flexibits</a> has created. It seems obvious now that I have it in my hands. It&#8217;s easily the best way to implement a calendar on the iPad.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The reason for Fantastical&#8217;s profound effect on me is due to its reminders integration. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img7.png" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">For the last few months, I&#8217;ve used memo books to keep track of daily tasks. Anything due within 48 hours was written down and tracked in my memo books while due dates beyond 48 hours were stored in <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2-for-iphone/id690305341?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v5At">Omnifocus</a>. I tried all sorts of organization palettes in my memo books. After boldly stating that DashPlus <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//-a-quick-review-of-the-dashplus-system">wasn&#8217;t the system for me</a>, I ended up using DashPlus exclusively for organizing my written tasks.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I tried <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://beginapp.co">Begin</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.dueapp.com">Due</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://dashplus.net">DashPlus (the iOS app)</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://realmacsoftware.com/clear">Clear</a> and <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://builtbysnowman.com/checkmark/">Checkmark</a> to keep track of day-to-day digital tasks. These apps are second to none. But none of these apps ever set in despite their awesome designs. For me, Fantastical&#8217;s implementation trumps all these apps. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I like how Fantastical for iPad keeps reminders and tasks stowed away in a side panel. The side panel can be swiped from the side and all your task lists can be tapped and maintained accordingly. These reminders immediately sync via iCloud Reminders and the updates can be seen quickly on my iPhone and Mac. With simple apps like Begin and Checkmark,<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> tasks didn&#8217;t sync through iCloud Reminders and I wasn&#8217;t able to keep track of lists until I pulled out my iPhone.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> With task lists in my memo book, I had to carry my book around everywhere I went. With Fantastical, I can check my tasks wherever I am situated and on whichever device I have in front of me. Most of all, I can see those tasks within the context of my calendar. This is awesome.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">It probably seems odd that I&#8217;m highlighting the reminders implementation of Fantastical. Evidently, the stock Reminders app has always been able to sync across the iPhone, iPad and Mac. It&#8217;s not new technology.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But iOS's Reminders apps look <em data-preserve-html-node="true">horrible</em> across the board. They aren&#8217;t fun to manage. They aren&#8217;t enjoyable to use. And most importantly, they can&#8217;t be integrated into one calendar.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That&#8217;s the kicker.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I finally have a place for all my events, all my daily tasks and all my due dates in one spot. That is the pinnacle of calendar management for me.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img6.png" /><h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Verdict</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Fantastical for iPad proved one thing to me very quickly: day-to-day tasks, due dates and events are all, in essence, of equal value. Prior to Fantastical, I had assigned day-to-day tasks, due dates and events in separate apps or separate notebooks. This inherently assigned a different level of significance to each of them.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With Fantastical, not only can I combine my productive needs into one location, I can also view that calendar on every single device I own. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In effect, Fantastical isn&#8217;t a calendar. It&#8217;s not even a task list. It&#8217;s a superior — &#8220;evolved&#8221; if you will — form of the calendar. It&#8217;s the 21st Century calendar. Your mom&#8217;s old wall calendar that circled important dates and highlighted important events has been replaced with a calendar that combines everything into one optimized area.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Fantastical has had a major impact on how I organize my life. For the first time, I carry around my iPad to view my schedule and to organize my task list. My iPhone and memo book can stay in my pocket.</p>
