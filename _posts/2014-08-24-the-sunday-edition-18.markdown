It was a crazy week here on The Newsprint and I thank everyone who decided to stick around. It's cool to see a blip on the analytics radar, but it's far cooler to know that The Newsprint's audience continues to grow and that there are people awesome enough to want to read some of this stuff. I'm completely flattered.

Onward and upward. I hope everyone has a great last week of summer holidays before heading back to school.
