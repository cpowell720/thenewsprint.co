I mean, obviously. 

**Update:** The BBC even discusses Louis Hartz's famous [*Fragment Theory*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Hartz) in this nifty travel piece. I studied Hartz's theory extensively during my first degree and I was mezmerized by how often it answered the reality of Canadian culture. I'm glad to see the BBC did a little research before writing up something involving the Canadian ethos.
