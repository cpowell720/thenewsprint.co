<p>Lan Anh Nguyen reporting for <em>Forbes</em>:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In mulling whether to pull Flappy Bird, Nguyen said that it was guilt – atop the fact that “my life has not been as comfortable as I was before” – that motivated him. “I couldn’t sleep,” he said. He added that his conscience is relieved; he spent the past few days, Internet-free, catching up on slumber.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The cultural underpinnings of this entire Flappy Bird scenario are fascinating. </p>

<p>The humility Dong Nguyen has expressed is admirable. I love his final comment:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When asked if there’s anything he wanted to tell disappointed users of the authentic Flappy Bird, Nguyen was concise: “Thank you very much for playing my game.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Nguyen obviously has altruistic intentions with the pulling of Flappy Bird but I don't think that makes him an <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/432290738135519232">idiot</a>. I'm encouraged to see someone <em>not</em> take the money, <em>not</em> indulge in the fame and <em>not</em> create products for the sake of earning a buck.</p>

<p>Dong Nguyen hit the jackpot. And he is also man enough to walk away from it. </p>

<p>Kudos to you Dong.</p>
