If — and this is a big if — Sony’s 20MP sensors end up in a future OM-D E-M1 Mark II camera body, you can be sure Olympus and the Micro 4/3 system will be around *well* into the future.

Up until two weeks ago, I was convinced the resolution constraints in the Micro 4/3 system didn’t truly matter. Ninety percent of people who look at photographs won’t notice resolution beyond 16MP, especially if they are viewing those images on a computer screen.

But then I purchased a 5K Retina iMac. And I started to notice those constraints. You can see things on this screen I never thought possible. 

In the long run, I think Olympus would be wise to push the resolution of Micro 4/3 sensors up a notch. Looks like Sony is paving the way for them.
