<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dowdyism">Brad Dowdy</a> is perhaps the world's premier <a href="http://penaddict.com">pen expert</a>. I've talked about his expertise before. </p>

<p>And yesterday, <em>Brad</em> talked about The Newsprint on his podcast with <a href="http://mykehurley.net">Myke Hurley</a>. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>The mention takes place around the 32:00 mark. Needless to say, you shouldn't head over and listen to <em>just</em> that part. I'm astounded about how much there is to know about pens and paper.</p>

<p>So much so that I just dropped a hefty sum of cash on pens and paper for the next year. </p>

<p>Thanks again to both Brad and Myke.</p>
