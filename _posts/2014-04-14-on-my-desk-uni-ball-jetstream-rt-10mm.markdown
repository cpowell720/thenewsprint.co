<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img9.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Pen blogging. I’m new to the foray and I finally want to join the party. I’ve tried to stay away, opting to hold back my opinions. I’m just not qualified to give them; I don’t know enough about inks, refills, nibs and the like to actually write a coherent review. But it’s also because I never paid enough attention in the past to which pen I was using. </p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">When I began carrying around a memo book a few months ago, I did some research for the best pen to carry around as well. A simple Google Search<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> yielded a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-pen/">Sweethome review</a> of the world famous <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.uniball-na.com/Pages/products.aspx">Uni-ball Jetstream</a>. Some of the top pen reviewers online recommend the Jetstream and my local Staples store ended up carrying the pen. I went down and grabbed a pack.</p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I bought the 1.0mm. I bet this completely changes my outlook of the Jetstream line. </p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Regardless, my first pen review is one of mixed feelings and a happy wife. Not mixed feelings about the happy wife, mind you.</p><h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Uni-ball Jetstream 1.0mm</h2><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img8.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Jetstream is more than just a single pen. Uni-ball has made an entire Jetstream line that incorporates higher end retractable pens and lower end capped pens. The one thing they supposedly all incorporate is Uni-ball’s world famous ballpoint writing experience.</p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">And there’s no doubting the writing experience of the 1.0mm. Prior to the Jetstream, I couldn’t have cared any less about which pen I picked up. When I began writing with the Jetstream, my eyes were opened and I saw the light. </p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">My new Jetstream is everything The Sweethome promised. The thick 1.0mm line flows super smooth on all the papers I have tried and the blue ink dries deep and true. Like most ballpoints, the Jetstream’s ink clumps up slightly every now and then, leaving juicy splotches here and there. However, this happens far less than any other ballpoint I’ve tried and I’m happy with the Jetstream’s results.</p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I bought the Jetstream in hopes of converting it into an everyday-carry (EDC) pen. In terms of EDC characteristics, I don’t think the Jetstream is your best bet. I have little experience regarding other EDC pens<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> but I can’t see this Uni-ball contingent being your go-to pen on-the-go. First off, my retractable Jetstream has opened a couple times in my back pocket. Second, the Jetstream is by no means a “small” pen. I grabbed a Zebra F301 for comparison purposes and the F301 is both smaller, thinner and lighter than the Jetstream. After grabbing the F301, and considering my impending Space Pen, I don’t see myself returning to the Jetstream as an everyday-carry pen.</p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">On that same note, I find myself gravitating to the Jetstream for all my office use. The heavy 1.0mm line dries quickly and rolls smoothly, allowing for quick photocopying of written papers and for proper show-through in carbon-copy paper.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img7.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Of immense importance is the paper on which one chooses to write, however. I tested the Jetstream on the three types of paper I have kicking around the house.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> Kraft Field Notes 50#T finch paper feels thinner than both Yupo and Moleskine paper, but there doesn’t appear to be any bleed-through from the thicker Jetstream line. The 1.0mm line does take longer than the F301 to dry on the Expedition Edition’s Yupo paper, which means I have a new favourite for my Expedition Editions. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img6.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The best writing experience comes while writing in my Extra Large Moleskine Cahiers. Besides the office, the classroom is the second location I find my Jetstream to be the most useful. As I’ve said in the past, my experience with Moleskine paper puts it at the top of my paper charts and the Jetstream glides along brilliantly. Little to no effort is necessary to leave a thick line and the rubberized exterior coating eliminates hand crapping in long sessions of Moleskine paper writing. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img5.jpg" /><h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Verdict</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">One of the best tests any product can go through is the “wife test”. My wife isn’t hellbent on using the latest, greatest or best tools on the market but she’s willing to humour my hobbies. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Further, my wife has always been a pencil-gal. She uses a mechanical pencil for all her schoolwork. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">When she tried the Jetstream 1.0mm, she instantly fell in love. In fact, she’s even talked about the pen on her downtime. It’s borderline incredible to hear her voluntarily talk about one of my hobbies. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">She recently wrote two long-answer essay-type questions in an exam and she found her hand cramping up while using her mechanical pencil. After switching to the Jetstream, she finished the paper with no cramping and a smile on her face.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> This tells me a lot about the ergonomics of the pen and about how well the pen writes. If my wife loves it, there must be something inside the Jetstream that’s pretty incredible.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I, in contrast, am a different story. The Jetstream is the best office pen that I’ve come across. The thick line is sometimes too thick, especially in my Expedition Editions, but writes beautifully on important paperwork. The line dries fairly quickly on standard paper and the minimized ballpoint-clumping makes it perfect for my type of office work.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">As an everyday-carry pen, however, I feel the Jetstream falls short. I don’t like the size of the pen in my back pocket and the retractable nature can lead to unforeseen problems. I see myself sticking to the Zebra F301 for everyday use until my Space Pen arrives.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In the end, like The Sweethome has stated, I do believe the Jetstream is one of the best pens on the market for the general population. It’s superb in comparison to standard office pens and it looks equally sharp. It’s even super cheap and can be picked up at any Staples or office supply store in your city. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For most people, this pen will definitely be a winner. For me, well, I’m still waiting to try out some other pens.</p>
