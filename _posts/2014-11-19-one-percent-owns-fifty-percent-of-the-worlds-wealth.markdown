Jill Treanor reporting for *The Guardian*:

> According to the [Credit Suisse global wealth report](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=60931FDE-A2D2-F568-B041B58C5EA591A4), a person needs just $3,650 – including the value of equity in their home – to be among the wealthiest half of world citizens. However, more than $77,000 is required to be a member of the top 10% of global wealth holders, and $798,000 to belong to the top 1%.

$3,650 is a frighteningly low number. 

My wager: If you're reading this right now, you're wealthier than half of the world's population. And, more likely than not, there are a fair few who would find themselves in the top 10% of the world's wealth holders.

I stress about money each and every day, yet I have more assets than 3.5 billion other people. 

This makes me sick to my stomach.
