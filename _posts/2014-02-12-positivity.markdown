<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I hate going on rants because I&#8217;m not good at ranting. Generally, I take too long to make my point and then I make that same point over and over. I&#8217;ll try to keep this short.</p>

<hr data-preserve-html-node="true">

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Negativity on the web has reached a level that I can no longer bear. Negativity is always somewhere, lurking in the shadows and ready to pounce on the uncontent. I&#8217;m not buying that garbage.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">There&#8217;s a clever scene in the chick-flick <em data-preserve-html-node="true">Hitch</em> that reminds me of this scenario: </p>

<hr data-preserve-html-node="true">

<blockquote data-preserve-html-node="true">
<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">What do you think of the design of the Jets&#8217; new football stadium on the West Side?</em></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">Let me guess. Disgusting?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr data-preserve-html-node="true">

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">When someone can guess what garbage you&#8217;re going to puke up next, and their guess is negativity, it&#8217;s time to clue in on your own goals. Negativity sells and it sells well, but there is nothing so degrading as a well-written article about how <em data-preserve-html-node="true">bad</em> a product is.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">There is a large difference between negative and honest. Honest experiences outline real-life scenarios and give some light to difficult questions. An honestly written article usually equates to <em data-preserve-html-node="true">advice</em>, whereas a negative article generally equates to a <em data-preserve-html-node="true">rant</em>.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I once read somewhere that 9to5Mac only reviews products that its writers or friends like. They skip negative product reviews because they feel negative reviews don&#8217;t add value. If a product doesn&#8217;t have the characteristics their writers are looking for, they just <em data-preserve-html-node="true">don&#8217;t review it</em>. Any time a product review comes down 9to5Mac&#8217;s pipeline, you can bet it's a good buy.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Positive reviews <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">are not</strong> about scratching someone&#8217;s back. Time, effort and piles of cash are invested into creating the tools we use on a daily basis. If you are thankful for a great product, say so. If you aren&#8217;t, outline the best parts of the product and make those parts shine. Why harp on the smallest negative qualities?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">There is nothing more uplifting than a happy customer or client. Someone outlining why they love something is inspirational and keeps the wheel turning. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So, in light of this rant, I will state my goal for reviewing or discussing products, tools and workflows on The Newsprint: If I believe a product is geniunely great, I will write about it and I will spread my love for the product as best I can. On the other hand, if I don&#8217;t enjoy said product, I won&#8217;t write a scathing article lambasting the product, its creators or its loyal users. I will always be honest with how I feel about a good product and my honesty will shine through my <em data-preserve-html-node="true">lack</em> of writing. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Simple. Positive. Honest. All without being negative. </p>
