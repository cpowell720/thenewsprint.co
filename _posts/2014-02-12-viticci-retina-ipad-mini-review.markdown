<p>The truest way to know if a product is insanely great is whether or not it sticks to you. A product's essence only becomes visible once novelty wears away.</p>

<p>Federico Viticci at <a href="http://macstories.net">Macstories</a> is a salient iPad user. His story is a touching one, whereby his past battle with cancer forced him to adapt how he worked and the tools that he used. Combine that with the fact that English is his second language and your jaw might just drop as you read his writing. </p>

<p>Federico has cleverly adapted his iPad into a power-user device. His iPad is proof that iOS can be used for <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-mini-for-content-creation/">content creation</a>. </p>

<p>I've always believed that time is the best measurement of a product's value. Federico nails this review, as is <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/">usually the case</a>.</p>
