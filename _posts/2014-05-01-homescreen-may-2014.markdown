<p>May has <em>finally</em> come. It's been raining in Southern Manitoba for the last few days, which generally leads to the snow completely melting away. Despite our efforts, there is still snow in the forecast.</p>

<p>But what May really brings is a chance at a second Homescreen installation. Here you go:</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img.png" /><p>For comparison purposes, you can head <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//homescreen-april-2014">here</a> to check out what has changed since April 1.</p>

<p>A quick list:</p>

<p>To start, my homescreen has <em>finally</em> been completely iOS 7-ified. That new <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> icon could be my favourite icon yet.</p>

<p>I moved Pushpin off my homescreen because I felt I didn't access my link archive enough to warrant it such a coveted spot. I use my iPad to manage my Pinboard, so I scarcely used Pushpin on the iPhone.</p>

<p>I have switched over to Unread for my RSS needs as of late. I love its reading experience. Ideally, I would like Unread for iPad and Reeder for iPhone to be my RSS combination. Reeder is faster at triaging feeds but its reading experience is mediocre. So, to get a good feel of Unread before the iPad version is released, I've been trying it out more extensively on the iPhone.</p>

<p>I have switched back to Fantastical 2 now that there is an accompanying iPad version. Agenda Calendar 4 is a beautiful app, but it's hard to fight with Fantastical's offering.</p>

<p>Despite writing a review of <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> — of which I'm still fully in love — I decided to bring Vesper back into the thick of things. Vesper's design is second to none and I've found Vesper to be a great way to capture thoughts on the go. This is an experiment still and I may end up back with Drafts. But Vesper is <em>really</em> nice to look at.</p>

<p>I've gone back to Mailbox again because of its new Auto-Swipe feature. Wow. Auto-swipe is easily the best thing I've come across for inbox management. I can't recommend it enough.</p>

<p>Lastly, I've switched my reminders app <em>again</em>. As a result, you can expect some thorough reviews over the next few weeks. I'm sick and tired of switching and I desperately want to find an app that works. I'm really impressed so far with Clear's implementation of reminders within lists. It fits me really well. This could switch in a heartbeat though.</p>

<p>I kind of like this monthly round-up. It's like a personal audit of my digital tools. Maybe I should consider doing the same with my pens and notebooks — it may make my bag a bit lighter.</p>
