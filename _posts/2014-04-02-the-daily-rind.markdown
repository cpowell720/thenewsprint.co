<p>I think one of the difficulties with analog notes is how easy they are to mould. Unlike a software application, paper notes have no boundaries. Paper notes can take nearly <em>any</em> form. And <em>The Daily Rind</em> takes this to heart. </p>

<p><em>The Daily Rind</em> is a system designed by Adam King — a Canadian might I add — that works to improve the flow of a work day. Rather than using regimented and lineal day planning, <em>The Daily Rind</em> uses a circular layout to define a day. </p>

<p>This is a really unique way of planning that is certainly not meant for me.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> I don’t know if this would work in a pocket notebook either, but it may be worth a try. </p>

<p>If, after experimenting with the different systems I’ve linked to, you still haven’t found an analog process that works for you, I recommend trying out <em>The Daily Rind</em>. Maybe it’ll hit the sweet spot. </p>
