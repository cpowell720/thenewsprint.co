Eric Fischer has created a super cool set of maps which outline *who* takes photos of major cities and *where* they are taken. It’s a pile of fun to guess the city based on the structure of the map.

Fischer denotes the following in the photo set:

* Blue points on the map are photos taken by locals (people who have taken pictures in this city dated over a range of a month or more).
* Red points are pictures taken by tourists (people who seem to be a local of a different city and who took pictures in this city for less than a month).
* Yellow points are pictures where it can't be determined whether or not the photographer was a tourist (because they haven't taken pictures anywhere for over a month). They are probably tourists but might just not post many pictures at all.

Once again, this isn’t helping my travel bug.
