<blockquote>
  <p><em>Thus, if I had the $10 million, I’d invest in Box. Unfortunately, I don’t, which gives me the luxury of sitting back and observing which matters more: consumer headway in a market where enterprise pays, or enterprise capability – and business model – with a smaller base.</em></p>

<p>I've been a Dropbox advocate for a long time, even as iCloud has attempted to subvert it. Ben importantly points out that that is because I am an <em>individual</em> user. </p>

<p>The big money for cloud storage is in enterprise. And Box is a step ahead. </p>

<p>Don't we all want $10 million to invest? That would be sweet.</p>
