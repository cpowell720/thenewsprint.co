This is some fantastic time-lapse videography. Borderline jaw-dropping. Be sure to watch this video in the highest definition possible. 

And, if you have four extra minutes, you should watch [Scientifantastic's video of Rio de Janeiro as well.](http://vimeo.com/m/73053894) It's probably even more impressive.
