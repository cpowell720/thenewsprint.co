<p>I know I <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//reeling-me-in">just linked</a> to a bunch of Marco's work, but yesterday's announcement will send a small shockwave through the online world:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The cost of saving my sponsorships is too high for my tolerance and the nature of this site, so I’ve decided to stop selling them.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>...</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Regardless of money, I’ll continue writing this site for the same reasons, and at the same frequency, that I always have: I love writing, and I must write. This is a creative outlet first and a business second.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>In some weird, geeky way, writers like <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John</a>, <a href="http://loopinsight.com">Jim</a>, <a href="http://kottke.org">Jason</a>, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn</a> and <a href="http://marco.org">Marco</a> are role models. They changed the way people view online writing and have created an avenue for self-publishers to shine. Each niche has its own highly influential persona and every aspiring self-publisher looks up to the most popular person in their field. Anything those influencers say or do has an impact on the rest of the field.</p>

<p>With that said, if Marco can't make a standardized revenue stream work, what does that say for the rest of the tech-publishing field? Looking at his specific situation — and I say this knowing very little — there are definitely other revenue streams that can keep Marco.org viable.</p>

<p>But what precedent does this set?</p>

<p>As The Newsprint continues to grow, I have envisioned ways in which sponsorships could become part of a miniscule revenue plan. I have done some math and tried to determine what prices I could theoretically charge. And I began researching other publisher methods to deliver sponsorships. </p>

<p>Now I'll reconsider. Just like every advertiser will be reconsidering their sponsorship dollars.</p>

<p>Maybe Marco.org click-through numbers are random and he doesn't represent a larger trend. But I'd be willing to bet this is true beyond the scope of Marco.org. </p>

<p>I hope I'm dreadfully wrong.</p>
