Prashant Gopal for Bloomberg:

> Brooklyn, New York, where a resident would need to devote 98 percent of the median income to afford the payment on a median-priced home of $615,000, was the least-affordable market, followed by San Francisco and Manhattan.

Jac and I have considered moving to Brooklyn to permanently place ourselves in the most amazing city in the world. 

I guess that dream has been crushed.
