<blockquote>
  <p><em>Michell Smith tells this story: Prior to his return to Apple, it was obvious that the company was in trouble. Larry Ellison had floated the idea of a hostile takeover of the company, but it seemed to some of us Apple watchers that then-CEO Gil Amelio’s turnaround plan might work.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I wrote an impassioned email to Steve at Pixar, pleading with him to find something else to do with his time.</em> “Please,” <em>I implored him,</em> “don’t come back to Apple, you’ll ruin it.” </p>
  
  <p><em>… And then he wrote the words I’ll never forget:</em></p>
  
  <p>“You may be right. But if I succeed, remember to look in the mirror and call yourself an asshole for me.”</p>
