I love link dumps like The Synopsis and [Audacious Fox](http://audaciousfox.com/). One comes at the beginning of the day and the other finishes off the day. Perfect.

Even better yet, The Synopsis now has a dash of Canadian in it. If you want to keep up with the biggest news stories of the day, and if you want to keep up with the best country in the world, why not head over to The Synopsis, eh?
