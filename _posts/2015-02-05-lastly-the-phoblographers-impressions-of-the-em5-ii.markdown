Last of my Olympus OM-D E-M5 II coverage for the day is The Phoblographer. Chris Gampat’s writing is always great, but I often find myself skipping the words to take in the photos instead. 

The Phoblographer always has the best photo-gear shots you can find on the web, and they aren’t letting us down with their images of the new E-M5 II. This camera looks simply delicious.
