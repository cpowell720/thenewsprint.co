I wrote my last final exam yesterday morning and the weight of the world feels like it has lifted off my shoulders. Christmas finally feels like it's here.

Disappointingly, my week of heavy study was met with one of the best writing weeks I've seen yet. I often exclaim about how much great writing there is on a weekly basis, but this weeks feels like no other. 

Grab some coffee, pour in some hazelnut sweetener, eat some peanuts, turn on the Christmas lights, and pull out your iPad: this Sunday Edition has loads of great stuff to read.
