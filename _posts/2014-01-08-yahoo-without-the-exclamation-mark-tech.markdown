<p>The New York Times is <em>the publication</em>. It is one of <em>the</em> reporting pinnacles. Times writers are elegant, informed and revered.</p>

<p>So when David Pogue <em>leaves</em> The New York Times to jumpstart Yahoo's technology department, you can bet something unsaid is afoot.</p>

<p>Yahoo Tech is Pogue's hand pushing Yahoo into the future. And I think it looks beautiful, especially the manner in which articles are loaded and closed without having to load a new page.</p>

<p>Some people don't like the new design of Yahoo Tech:</p>

<p>I think it's a beautiful step forward. People <em>love</em> visual website designs — look at The Verge. That kind of design works.</p>

<p>Yahoo has done a great job with Yahoo Tech and I can't wait to see where David Pogue takes it.</p>
