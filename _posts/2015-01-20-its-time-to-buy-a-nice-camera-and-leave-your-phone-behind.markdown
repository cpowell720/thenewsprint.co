Chris Plante of *The Verge* talking about his regret of using a smartphone camera for his college years:
 
>  I remember how phone photos looked acceptable — close enough to film that I couldn’t really tell the difference. But now it’s obvious these pictures have their own fussy disposable camera-like qualities. They’re almost universally flat, grainy, and small. And because the phones' cameras couldn’t handle even the slightest hint of darkness, they're scorched by the world’s cheapest flash.
 
Don't fall into the same trap Chris fell into. Be proactive, buy a real camera, and take real photographs that look great decades into the future.
