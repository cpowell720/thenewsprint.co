<p>One of the most difficult things about studying in a business/accounting/entrepreneurship program is understanding the importance of risk-taking. I am a <em>horrible</em> risk-taker. I couldn&#8217;t imagine not having a job. Maybe that&#8217;s the stage of life I&#8217;m in, or maybe it&#8217;s part of my personality. To lose my job without notice and without future compensation would be hell.</p>

<p>Brett Peters accepts it with open arms. I admire his courage. It&#8217;s the single trait I wish I had. </p>

<p>The best nugget in his experience are his physical Field Notes books:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Those notebooks are what I can point to. Those twenty-two slender volumes represent â€¦ something. Time. Labor. Things that I built which are no longer there, but dammit, they had value. I managed millions of dollars of telecom spend and projects with them. I brought in revenue with them.</em></p>

<p>I love vindication. Physical record of our most important thoughts, ideas and tasks still trumps the ever-changing digital environment. These Field Notes books are the only evidence of his incredible amounts of work. </p>

<p>Absolutely powerful. At least for me. </p>
