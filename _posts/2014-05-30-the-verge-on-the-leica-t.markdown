Dan Seifert [writing for *The Verge*](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/30/5755088/leica-t-mirrorless-camera-review):

> The reality of the matter is that if you were hoping to get the real Leica experience in a digital camera for the bargain price of under $4,000, the T isn’t going to cut it. It’s a fine camera, if a bit slow and heavy, but it doesn’t really provide any different or better of an experience than any other mirrorless camera you can get for far less money (and in many cases, it’s a worse experience).

I really wanted to believe there was *something* behind that $3600. It's becoming increasingly difficult to justify a Leica T purchase decision.
