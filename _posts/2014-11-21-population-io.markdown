This is pretty neat.

* There are currently 2.8 billion people roaming the earth who are younger than me. 
* If I wasn't living in Canada, my projected date of death would be June 12, 2068.
* If I were living in the United States, my projected date of death would be August 14, 2074.
* Thankfully I'm living in Canada. My projected date of death is December 14, 2076.

Although morbid, it's fun to imagine having an impact on the world so far into the future.
