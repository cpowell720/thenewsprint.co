My sister was engaged a few days before Christmas 2014. Her and her fiancé dated for a few years in high school and they are now set on starting their life together. Insanely, they asked me to shoot their engagement photos. Long story short: I learnt that I am not a wedding photographer. But, I think some of the photos turned out alright nonetheless.

My sister is five years younger than I am, so we grew up at fairly different segments of our lives.[^1] As a result, Rachel and I never had shared interests or commonalities to be drawn upon.

So why does our history play a role in this piece? 

Because I was incredibly *honoured* when she asked me to take these photos. I’m not a professional, and I’m certainly not her closest friend, but she asked me to shoot the photos anyhow. I really appreciated the opportunity to share one of these bridal experiences with my sister and I hope it captured some memories for her as well.

I learnt more about my sister that day than any other aspect, but I certainly soaked in the photography lessons as well.

Without a doubt, planning became the single factor I wished I had put more time into. I did a bunch of research beforehand — I researched popular setups and backdrops, great types of lighting, and things to say to your “clients”. Even with all that research, I still could have spent more time in the books to help smooth the process of setting up and creating the photo I had in my head.[^2]

I learnt pretty quickly that the [Olympus 75mm f/1.8](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CI3TQSO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CI3TQSO&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=HFRWNK6CZDDZXKYS) was a fantastic tool for the job. I brought along the [Panasonic Lumix 20mm f/1.7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJS830Y/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DJS830Y&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=3YHZZ4INWCBWAZL2) pancake lens as well, but the 20mm focal length actually brought me in fairly close and I noticed Rachel and Carl become slightly uncomfortable. This quickly exposed the necessity for the true “wedding focal lengths” between the 24mm and 70mm full-frame marks. Without a doubt, the 75mm solidified itself as the perfect portrait prime lens for Micro 4/3. In contrast, the 20mm pancake made it clear that it’s suited best for everyday purposes and casual street photography.

I don’t know how many opportunities I’ll have to shoot portraits of people, but I learnt my lesson for not having that convenient 24-70mm zoom lens in my kit. Ever since our small photoshoot, I’ve had my sites set on the [Olympus’ 12-40mm f/2.9 Pro lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY3YGBS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EY3YGBS&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=WI6E3MNF5YD4UBT4). I think a lens of that flexibility would be ideal for any portraits I end up taking at her wedding or on any travels my wife and I decide to embark on.

All in all, I learnt a ton that Sunday morning. I learnt about early morning light, portrait photography, and research habits. 

I also learnt a different kind of pride that perhaps only older brothers can understand. I looked at my youngest sister with a warm sense of compassion. The man she has beside her is deserving of such a strong woman and I can’t imagine anyone other than Carl taking care of her.

Congratulations Rachel and Carl. I’m truly looking forward to the end of September and beyond.

[^1]: Yes, if you’ve done the math in your head, you’ll rightly determine my sister is still a very young lady. Regardless, these two people were meant for each other since day one and I’m very excited for them to get started together.

[^2]: Actually, in *our* heads, as Jaclyn came along and was masterful at creating scenes. I can take very little credit for the different types of photos you see here.
