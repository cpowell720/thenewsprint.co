I'm finding more and more *news* articles online that I think might of interest. As a result, The Sunday Edition keeps getting larger and larger.

In the past, The Sunday Edition's aim was to highlight the best writing of the week. However, as time has gone on, I can't help but want to pass along interesting news articles that don't show up on everyone's timelines each day. 

If this is bothersome, please let me know.

Otherwise, enjoy the plethora of awesome stuff from the past week.
