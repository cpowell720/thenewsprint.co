title: The Simplest Punctuation Has Become A Sign Of Anger

<p><em>I wrote and rewrote the title of this linked post three or four times. "The Angry Period" just didn't seem to suggest the meaning I intend to convey.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>The power of the full stop (a period, in proper linguistic terms) is by far the most exciting of any punctuation mark. It marks the end of an entire thought — an entire thought that was once a mere idea and is now free to roam the world.</p>

<p>I don't know how artsy you can get when it comes to grammar and punctuation, and I don't even want to try.</p>

<p>But this article touches on something deeper than just evolving punctuation. Ben Crair touches on an evolution of language that is perpetuitous and infinite. </p>

<p>It's only a matter of time before these nuances are accepted in schools.</p>
