<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/75555794917/designing-unread">Jared Sinclair</a>, known for creating the beautiful <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://app.net">App.net</a> client <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://riposteapp.net/">Riposte</a>, just released a new type of RSS app called <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://jaredsinclair.com/unread/">Unread</a>. The app uses a gorgeous combination of typography, animations and gestures to create one of the most inviting apps on the App Store. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I don&#8217;t have a full review here, nor do I plan to in the foreseeable future. I believe a much better sense of an app&#8217;s utility is experienced over a lengthier period of time. Having said that, if you want to read an <em data-preserve-html-node="true">incredible</em> review<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> head on over to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://shawnblanc.net/2014/02/unread-for-iphone-a-new-breed-of-rss-reader/">ShawnBlanc.net</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I&#8217;ve never experienced an RSS app with the ability to send text to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> however. I think this is why I will stick with Unread for a while. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I find much of the content for The Newsprint via Twitter and RSS. I follow my favourite writers in RSS and my favourite topics in Twitter. Generally, anything I want to check into later on Twitter is saved in Instapaper. And up until yesterday, I held the same protocol with interesting articles in <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now, however, with the ability to share to Drafts, I can save the first few sentences of an article — or a highlighted quote of my choice — with the name of the author and a URL to the article by pressing one button. The generated draft leaves a notification badge on my homescreen and I can decide what I want to do with that note at a later time. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/unread-review/#more-34000">Super simple</a>. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The power of Drafts takes over at that point, and URL actions can be created to share, annotate and mark up the draft. I also really like Drafts&#8217; sync feature with the iPad version, meaning my quotes and saved articles end up on both devices within seconds.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> Instapaper was never a problem for this workflow, but I like the ease in manipulating drafts.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This unique sharing feature is part of <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/overshare/overshare-kit">Overshare</a> which was designed by Sinclair himself. The ability to send text from an RSS app is something I&#8217;ve never experienced before and I love the potential. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For this reason, and this reason alone, I foresee Unread supplanting Reeder as my RSS client of choice on the iPhone.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">All of Shawn&#8217;s reviews have a unique blend of personality and geekdom. His writing is one of a kind. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I am absolutely dying for a Mac version of Drafts. It&#8217;s evidently <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/425808990845403136">not in the works</a> and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll have to live with. But a Mac app would suit this workflow just perfectly. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
