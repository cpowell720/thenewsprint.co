> The Fuji X100T is the world's best digital camera because no other camera has its ability to capture great photos perfectly in any light, all usually on the very first shot. It's also the world's quietest camera, with a completely silent electronic shutter.

I don't know if I have the courage to switch to a prime, fixed-lens system, but this [X100T](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NF6ZGY6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NF6ZGY6&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=BQBS34KKWIIYD3IR) looks absolutely fantastic. 

I am also quite intrigued with the prospects of the [upcoming Olympus E-M5 Mk. II.](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/12/09/never-mind-olympus-omd-em5-mk-ii-said-stick-original-em5-sensor/#.VIibwFhOKrU) The E-M10 is all I need, but I'm willing to let Olympus do some convincing in the near future.
