It's been a terribly slow week for me. Like an immature school kid, I'm going to make an excuse for myself. After Saturday's major event out of the way, I expect to have a little more time on my hands. Sorry about that.

Anyway. It was a crazy week on Apple techblogs. You've read all those already, so here are a few articles that slipped through the cracks.
