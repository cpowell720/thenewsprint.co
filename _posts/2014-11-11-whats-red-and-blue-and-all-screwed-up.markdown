Hipster Conservative: 

> My confusion lies in the fact that these colors, red for Republican and blue for Democrat, are so obviously wrong. They defy the long-standing tradition, found among numerous modern countries, of red’s association with political leftism and blue’s with conservatism. 

Just another unique American characteristic that completely baffles me.

But hey, at least they only have two parties to choose from. Imagine having to vote for the yellows, greens and [the Rhinos](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_Party).
