Occasionally, Field Notes Brand releases exclusive editions of their notebooks for companies or events. [XOXO Festivals](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/glitch/) and TED Talks events have had exclusive editions created just for their attendees. [JC Penney](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brinstar/8602173438/) and [Levi's](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/2010/07/08/levis-and-field-notes/) have also had editions created that were sold exclusively in their stores.

These editions can run you hundreds of dollars on the open market. They are exceedingly rare and are certainly only printed once.

So, naturally, when Field Notes Brand announced a specially designed Field Notes book for the [Starbucks Reserve Roastery,](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/2014/11/20/starbucks-reserve-roastery-edition/) I was immediately entranced.

Extremely disappointing, however, was the pickup location. These books could only be purchased at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Seattle. If you weren't able to swing by that location, you would have to hire someone to pick up a pack for you or you'd have to enter [the viciously expensive eBay market.](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=field+notes+roastery&_from=R40%7CR40%7CR40&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xfield+notes+roastery+edition&_nkw=field+notes+roastery+edition&_sacat=0)

I got really, really lucky a few weeks ago when I asked Twitter if anyone was willing to send a spare Roastery book my way. Brad Dowdy contacted me and generously sent the other half of his pack to me. He also threw in a few extra goodies, which I can't wait to give a full review in the future. So, to that end, I want to sincerely thank Brad for sending this book â€” he is far too generous.[^1]

This will not be a full on review of the special Roastery Edition. Exclusive editions are very hard to come by, so the chances of someone Googling "Roastery Edition" for the sake of making a purchase won't happen very often. I've always wanted The Newsprint's reviews to help readers in determing the good stuff from the junk stuff. As far as the Roastery Edition goes, you certainly wouldn't be buying junk. But, I doubt people will be flocking to eBay's doors with the purpose of dropping more than $50 USD on a two-pack.

Instead of a review, I figured I would shoot a pile of photographs for your visual pleasure. The Roastery Edition could be the most beautiful edition ever created by Field Notes Brand and there's no better way to showcase Roastery's beauty than by giving it to you in broad daylight.

The Roastery Edition is the same size as the one-of-a-kind [Arts and Sciences Colors edition](http://thenewsprint.co/2014/06/16/field-notes-arts-and-sciences/) from Summer 2014. The notebook's dimensions are 4-3/4" by 7-1/2". Oddly, these dimensions are not spelled out in Roastery's "Specifications" section on the inside back cover.

The covers are made of a birch wood veneer instead of the cherry wood veneer found in [Spring 2014's Shelterwood Colors edition.](http://thenewsprint.co/2014/03/31/on-my-desk-field-notes-shelterwood-edition/) The birch covers are significantly more flexible than the cherry wood covers. I'm not sure if this can be chalked up to the additional size of the Roastery Edition, or if the birch covers in general are more flexible than cherry.

The front and back covers are stamped with a copper foil that shimmers in different angles of light. The copper/birch combination is simply gorgeous.

Roastery is bound by three copper staples.

Roastery's insides are printed with an application of "Safety Orange" ink. This orange colour definitely caught me off guard. The colour fits the theme perfectly, but I only realized afterwards that it all worked.

The inside front and back covers have a bunch of coffee-related nuggets for the Alex Trebeck in you. Perhaps the best list ever concocted is the "Pairings" list on the inside back cover. Supposedly, I've been drinking my Columbian coffee at quite the wrong times.

Lastly, Roastery has been stuffed with standard 50#T Finch paper. Field Notes Brand gave Roastery an orange dot grid, which should please many fans. A book this size is well suited for a dot grid and, if I had a sealed pack, I would certainly enjoy the grid pattern as a desk book at the office.

I wanted to keep my Roastery thoughts to a minimum this time around, but I can't help but exclaim one simple fact: Roastery is probably the most beautiful Field Notes edition ever created. Shelterwood's cherry veneer is pleasant enough, but this lighter birch colour is almost perfect. Couple that with copper foil and orange accents and you've got yourself an absolutely stunning notebook.

Which kind of sucks really, because I would love to use one of these books every day of the week. Instead, due to its rarity, Roastery will find a comfortable home atop my bookshelf. I'll pull it out from time to time to show off to would-be fans.

Perhaps I'll frame it.

Yep. That's a great idea.
