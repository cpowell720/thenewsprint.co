<p>There are two major industries that have not yet been revolutionized by next generation computers: televisions and automobiles. </p>

<p>I feel Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ios/whats-new/">iOS in the Car</a> is a better implementation of connectivity and software applications. I find myself increasingly wanting my iPhone to be <a href="http://techpinions.com/smartphones-are-becoming-the-hub-of-our-digital-lifestyles/25217">my hub</a> and all other devices to feed off of it. </p>

<p>Chevrolet's implementation of automobile connectivity, like the rest of the industry, is one step behind.</p>
