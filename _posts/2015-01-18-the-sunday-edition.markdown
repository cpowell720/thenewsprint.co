I'm particularly proud of this week's Sunday Edition. I honestly think it's one of the best ever. It's jam-packed with great photography, an incredibly well-written piece by the venerable Tom Hanks, and a story of subliminal introduction to the wonderful world of pens. And that doesn't include any bag reviews that popped up during the week. 

Overall, it was a good week to be on the Internet. Enjoy your Sunday afternoon reads.
