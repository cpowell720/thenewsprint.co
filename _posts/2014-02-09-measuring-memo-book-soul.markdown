<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Chris Gonzalez&#8217;s awesome <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://unretrofied.com/?category=Artifacts">Artifacts series</a> highlighted <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://patrickrhone.com/">Patrick Rhone</a> recently. Patrick uses a beautiful Field Notes cover made by <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://hellbrandleather.bigcartel.com/product/chromexcel-field-notes-cover">Hellbrand Leather</a> and my recent switch to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//giving-up-on-digital-notes">memo books</a> had me squeeling with delight. I quickly bought the memo book cover and began researching the countless types of memo books on the market.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I mentioned my recent experience with <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/cahier/">Moleskine Pocket Cahiers</a> and I&#8217;ve been fairly delighted. But there is an obvious obsession with <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes Brand</a> memo books that caught my eye. I read 10 different comparisons of Moleskine Pockets and Field Notes and all of them concluded with indifference. The major differences:</p>

<ul data-preserve-html-node="true">
<li data-preserve-html-node="true">Field Notes are stapled; Moleskine Pockets are sewn</li>
<li data-preserve-html-node="true">Field Notes have a whiter, thinner paper; Moleskine Pockets use a superior quality of paper with a yellow tinge</li>
<li data-preserve-html-node="true">Field Notes have beautiful documentation on the inside and back covers; Moleskine Pockets have a pocket inside the back cover that disappointingly rips with ease</li>
</ul>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">However, the biggest difference is in brand loyalty. Field Notes users are brand advocates and there seems to be a type of loyalty that I want to jump into. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The video in this link is a beautiful take on Field Notes Colors subscriptions and the value found <em data-preserve-html-node="true">inside</em> a saturated memo book. I never imagined I would find such devotion and passion when researching memo books.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Hellbrand Leather memo book cover comes with one Field Notes book inside and I can&#8217;t wait to try it out myself. If I&#8217;m even half impressed, count me in for a subscription.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>
