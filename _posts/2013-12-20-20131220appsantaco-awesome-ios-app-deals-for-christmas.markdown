<p>Apple devices are always a hot gift item this time of year. And there is no better way to setup that device than with the hottest sales on the greatest apps in the App Store.</p>

<p>Appsanta, inspired by <a href="http://macsanta.com">Macsanta</a>, is a collaboration between individual developers who offer their high quality apps at a discount over the holidays.  </p>

<p>Some of my favourite apps are on sale this year and I can't encourage you enough to grab them now. You'll increase the utility of your device and you'll support some incredible developers while you're at it.</p>

<p>Some of my favourites offered this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are other awesome apps on sale through Appsanta.co, and I can't wait to grab a couple of them myself.</p>

<p>Also, there are some other great sales over the holidays that aren't included in the Appsanta.co collaboration.</p>
