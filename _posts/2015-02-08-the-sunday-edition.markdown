My Instapaper queue was brimming this week with amazing work. There are some videos, some Flickr grids, some how-tos, some reviews, and even some political and financial reads you may find enjoyable.

On another note, I had a cup of Van Houtte Colombian Medium coffee with a dash of hazelnut sweetener while compiling this edition. I brewed it in a Keurig machine with a K-Cup refillable filter so I didn't hurt the environment too much. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am not yet convinced I need to brew my coffee in a special way or use special beans to drink something magical. 

I'd love to be proven wrong though.
