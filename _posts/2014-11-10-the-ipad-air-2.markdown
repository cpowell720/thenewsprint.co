When I originally pitched the idea to review the [iPad Air 2 for Tools and Toys,](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-ipad-air-2/) I had prematurely written off the device. Apple's keynote seemed to stress the iterative progress of the iPad, so I assumed my current iPad Air was far and away sufficient for my purposes.

Then I began using the iPad Air 2.

I'm convinced this is a far bigger update than people are giving Apple credit for. The thinner body, boosted speeds, added RAM, and laminated screen make for a perfect evening/couch computer for me. 

I've bought four iPads over the past few years. Usually the honeymoon phase wears off around the two week mark and I tend toward my MacBook or iPhone. For the first time, my iPhone and MacBook have sat idly by each and every evening since the iPad Air 2 arrived.

My iPad Air is now up for sale.[^1] I'm making the upgrade to the Air 2. I love this thing.
