This Forbes article is a little old already, but it's one of those articles that results from a few clicks down a rabbit hole. The most mesmerizing stat: Floyd Mayweather made $105 million for *72 minutes of work* in the 12 months prior to June. Holy smokes.

My rabbit holes almost always begin with some sort of business or financial article. This specific time, it started with the [NHL's highest paid players for the 2014-2015 season.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/11/25/the-nhls-highest-paid-players-2014-15/) I'm a big Sidney Crosby fan, so anything reporting on his financial earnings had me chomping at the bit.

And, along those same lines, Forbes just reported on the [valuations of NHL teams for the 2014-2015 season.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2014/11/25/the-most-valuable-teams-in-the-nhl/) NHL club valuations rose an average of 18.6% following a massive Rogers Communications deal to broadcast all games in Canada. (Which, by the way, is the worst thing to happen to hockey broadcasting in our country. Coverage has improved, but the broadcasters/commentators/analysts involved take away from CBC's famous Hockey Night in Canada experience.) 

Lastly, I'm proud to see that three of the six most valuable NHL clubs are located north of the border. Without a doubt, hockey is our game both on the ice and at the box office.
