Other than the obvious thoughts of “Wow, that looks like so much fun!” and “Woah, look at that incredible scenery!”, the questions that go through my head are simple: 

* Who *invented* the wingsuit?
* What was the first flight like?

Did someone jump off the side of a cliff, with a newly invented suit and without any training, and fly through the air at a breakneck speed? 

I can’t imagine ever mustering the fortitude to do something like that.
