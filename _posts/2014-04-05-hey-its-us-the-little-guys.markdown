<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I started my last piece with the admission of an error. I <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//power-of-the-retweet">once said</a> that the Retweet makes Twitter powerful. I was wrong. I made sure to rectify that error by discussing Twitter&#8217;s accessibility power.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Boy was I wrong again.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I had no idea the piece would usher in viewers from all over the world. For those visitors that decide to stay around a while, I&#8217;m honoured. I hope I can keep it up.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I also had no idea that the piece would strike some hearts. Two absolutely <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">fantastic</strong><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> articles were written in response to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//hey-its-me-the-little-guy">“Hey! It&#8217;s Me, The Little Guy”.</a> Scotty Loveless over at <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.overthought.org/blog/2014/the-outsider-and-the-creed">Overthought.org</a> penned a thought-provoking creed that all of us would benefit by reading. And <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.conormcclure.net/blog/2014/4/hey-its-me-the-little-guy">Conor McClure</a> quickly showcased the less bright side of Twitter&#8217;s accessibility.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In short, they both defined &#8220;success&#8221; in two totally different ways. And I&#8217;m appalled with myself for not recognizing both. For that I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Like the Retweet, the Favourite<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> is a superb form of flattery. It highlights those 140-character blurbs that hit someone&#8217;s heart. Venturing through a list of favourited tweets is much like strolling down memory lane in a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v5At">Day One</a>. To be a part of that is extremely humbling.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Since I started The Newsprint, Twitter has opened up a world of fellow self-publishers who are keen to interact, compliment and aid in the creative process. Although I have never met these individuals, I consider them friends. If I end up in the same city, I would do anything to enjoy a cup of coffee with them. And when I hit the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button, I glue my eyes to my Twitter feed to see which of them has an opinion first. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">These individuals create the inspiration needed to throw something online. A quick Favourite here, a quick Mention there. Twitter&#8217;s smaller features have created the environment necessary for communities to thrive. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And I&#8217;m lucky enough to be a part of a small community.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This piece is dedicated to those guys. I love the feedback. I love the conversation. And I love the passion. Between <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://crateofpenguins.com">Sid</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://conormcclure.net">Conor</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://thetypist.com">The Typist</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://overthought.org">Scotty</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://zacjszewczyk.com/Structure/index.htm">Zac</a> and most recently <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://penaddict.com">Brad</a>, I&#8217;ve got a great group of friends who are there to guide me along this process.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">More than that, and <em data-preserve-html-node="true">exactly</em> like <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/twitter-not-about-number-of-followers">Sid stated previously</a>, these &#8220;little guys&#8221; inspire a drive to create at a far greater level than any &#8220;big guy&#8221;. While the &#8220;big guy&#8221; drives interest and traffic, the &#8220;little guys&#8221; drive support and satisfaction.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">To the little guys: Thank You. To the big guys: Thank You. To my readers: Thank You.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now, back to reviewing some products. This heartfelt writing is going to make me tear up.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">His compliments are also extremely flattering, although I don&#8217;t know where he gets his evidence. I&#8217;ve written some crap.

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Yes, &#8220;Favourite&#8221; with a &#8220;u&#8221;. That&#8217;s proper English right there.  <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">While I&#8217;m at it, I want to throw <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://thetechblock.com">The Tech Block</a> into this mix. They do a fabulous job of highlighting lowly writers like myself. On the same note, they are one of us &#8220;little guys&#8221;, especially in relation to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://recode.net">Recode</a> or <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a>. Despite not conversing with them on a daily basis, I consider The Tech Block as a leader in this small online community. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:4" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
