Here we are, back again with another homescreen. I think it's been a slow month in terms of app releases and updates, and my homescreen is proof. I only have a few changes heading into July.

After purchasing an Olympus E-M10, I found myself digging around for Apple's Photos app in my pages of app folders. I've put Photos on my homescreen now, and I'm tempted to put it in my dock too. I'm constantly heading in to organize and delete photos or create new albums to share to family. 

I still await a(n) URL scheme for Vesper. I don't know if it will ever come, but iOS 8's Extensibility features should make Vesper more open to apps like Drafts and Editorial. Until that day, Vesper is on my second homescreen.

Lastly, I have really come around on the value of Tumblr's social network. There's so much great content roaming around Tumblr's timelines and I can't help but want to be a part of it. So I've started a Tumblr for The Newsprint and I've ushered Tumblr's nifty iOS app onto my homescreen. If you want to check out The Newsprint's Tumblr, you can [check it out here](http://thenewsprintco.tumblr.com).

Here's to hoping for a bigger-screened phone in our hands sometime this summer.

Happy Canada Day!
