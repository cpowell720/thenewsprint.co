Dear Friends and Family,

As we enter the heart of the Christmas season, we wish you a merry Christmas and a blessed new year. 

In our circle of friends and our corner of the Internet, there appears to be a trend away from gift-giving and a focus on rest, relaxation, and fellowship. We couldn't be more happy with this trend. The truest spirit of the season is found in the laughter and enjoyment of our friends and family and we hope the chorus of joy is plentiful in your household this year. 

Over the last few days, we have set goals to catch up with our grandparents and with our friends who we have lost touch with. Without a doubt, the joy of catching up with old friends and discussing the past and future with our grandparents have been the most fascinating elements of our Christmas season so far. If you have someone you have fallen out of touch with, we hope you are able to see their faces again over the next few days and enjoy the bundles of laughter that are bound to be headed your way. In the end, family will always be the most important group of friends we possess and there is no better time to rekindle that fellowship than around the Christmas dinner table.

From our home to yours, we wish you a blessed Christmas and a prosperous new year.
