<p>They say the best camera is the one you have with you. That's the rule of thumb.</p>

<p>And the camera on your phone is not only as good as most point-and-shoots, it can also edit, backup and organize your photo library before uploading it to your social network of choice. It's photography of the future. </p>

<p>So unless you have <em>specific</em> needs, don't buy a dedicated camera. Buy a high-end smartphone.</p>
