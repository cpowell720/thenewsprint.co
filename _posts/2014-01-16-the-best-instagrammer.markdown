<p>My wife's <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//facebook-less-freedom">recent rejection of Facebook</a> led me to consider cutting away some of my own needless social networks. Obviously, Facebook and Twitter made the cut. Instagram, on the other hand, was on the bubble.</p>

<p>I started to do some research on Instagram and I stumbled upon this incredible photographer. Murad Osmann began his #followmeto photography campaign a little while back and he has developed the campaign into one of the most popular feeds on Instagram. I love his style of photography and the accompanying story is beyond words.</p>

<p>Everyone's Instagram feed should be enhanced by an <em>actual</em> photographer. Why not enhance yours by following one of the best Instagrammers on the 'net?</p>
