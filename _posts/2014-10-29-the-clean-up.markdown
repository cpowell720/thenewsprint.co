We get to see these guys play 162 games each year, yet rarely do we get a glimpse of the locker room behind the scenes. Even more rare is getting a glimpse of one of the greatest players cleaning house for the very last time.

The Captain's smile brims with relief, relaxation, and excitement in these photos. I can't imagine being able to look at the world with nearly no restraints — privacy being the biggest exception — and actually having the ability to *make a difference*. Mr. November is in those shoes right now and it seems he's ready and willing to be more than just a baseball legend.
