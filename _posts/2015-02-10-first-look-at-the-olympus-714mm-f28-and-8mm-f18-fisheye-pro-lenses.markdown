This is one of the first proper looks at the upcoming Olympus 7-14mm f/2.8 Pro and Olympus 8mm f/1.8 Fisheye Pro lenses. Although the development of these lenses [was announced](http://zuikopro.olympus-imaging.com/en/) some time ago, very little has been shown by way of video or photographs. We now have something to go off of.

As expected, both these lenses look to mimic the fit and finish of Olympus’ current Pro lenses. The 7-14mm looks to be about the same size as the current [12-40mm f/2.8 Pro](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY3YGBS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EY3YGBS&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=RTMZL47B3OCQC3HP) while the 8mm Fisheye lens appears to be the same size as the [Olympus 75mm f/1.8 prime lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY3YGBS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EY3YGBS&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=RTMZL47B3OCQC3HP). 

Somewhat surprising to me is the 7-14mm’s partial external zoom. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but the zoom mechanism doesn’t fit into the lens body in the same manner as the [Olympus 40-150mm f/2.8 Pro](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NGSLSK4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NGSLSK4&linkCode=as2&tag=thenews02-20&linkId=L5FK3MPZTQGNVPAL). 

Rumors peg the 7-14mm Pro lens [price at $1,800 USD](http://petapixel.com/2014/05/29/rumor-points-olympus-announcing-7-14mm-f2-8-mft-soon-priced-1800/), which puts it on the steep side when compared to the current Pro lens lineup.

I can’t wait to see this thing in action.
