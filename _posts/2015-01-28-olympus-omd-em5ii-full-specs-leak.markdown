The E-M5II is weather resistant. That [was the kicker.](https://twitter.com/joshuaginter/status/555913776290365440)
 
Iâ€™m now going to have a hard time keeping my wallet in my pocket on February 5.

**Update**: Looks like more photos [have been leaked](http://www.43rumors.com/ft5-new-images-of-the-olympus-e-m5ii-price-info-in-pounds/) of the new camera as well as its pricing in pounds. Pricing in pounds is difficult to measure though, as current prices of the OM-D E-M10 are in the 500 pound range (which equates to about $950 Canadian dollars). If these inflated UK prices are indeed correct, I'll speculate a price of $1300 CDN for the E-M5II body and about $2000 CDN for the E-M5II and M. Zuiko 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro kit. If that kit pricing is about right, you're getting an incredible camera/lens combo for the money.
