Life often seems to flow like that of a business cycle — I can find myself in a rut for weeks on end where nothing changes and, within a split second, everything can change in a day. I've always felt our character is developed in how we handle those short spurts of change. 

This past week was a changing week. A good changing week, luckily. I can now get to where I want to go faster and more efficiently. 

Sometimes it doesn't work that way. Sometimes it feels like it *never* works that way. Those times are the worst. 

In light of this career change, I had to start this Sunday Edition with a fantastic short piece on professional attire. It couldn't have come through my RSS feed at a better time.
