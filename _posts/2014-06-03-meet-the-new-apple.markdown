[Joshua Topolsky:](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/3/5776030/meet-the-new-apple)

> But the big story — and the big picture — is that Apple seems to have come out of deep freeze. It feels light, like it's moving forward. Like the cobwebs have brushed aside, and things are going to get fun again. Everything we saw at WWDC's keynote points to a very interesting next few months for Apple — a period that will undoubtedly come into deep focus around the fall, when the company tends to roll out its major hardware updates.

There are a few things Mr. Topolsky states that feel slightly assumptive, especially in regards to Apple's last two years. However, his vision of the "new Apple" — as if there was a need of a rebirth — is overwhelmingly positive.

If I didn't do a good enough job reflecting this positivity [last night](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/06/03/on/), then head on over to get a better feeling of Apple's keynote yesterday.
