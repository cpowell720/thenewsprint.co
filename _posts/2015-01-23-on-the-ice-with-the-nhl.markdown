GoPro just [signed a deal with the NHL](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/23/7877525/nhl-gopro-during-games) to have their cameras broadcast live footage during games.
 
Just imagine the effects this deal will have. If the MLB gets on board, viewers will get to see a 100 MPH Aroldis Chapman fastball skim the inside part of the plate from the point of view of the batter. Or imagine watching Tom Brady scan the field to find an open receiver as multiple linebackers bear down on the quarterback. Better yet, imagine watching Sid the Kid split the defencemen and slide the puck through the goaltender’s five-hole for an overtime win – all from his helmet camera.
 
The possibilities are endless.
 
To give you a taste of the potential footage, check out this video. The speed at which these players move on the ice is dizzying. This is the future of live sports footage.
