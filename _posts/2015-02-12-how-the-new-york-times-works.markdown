If you’re even remotely curious about the day-to-day operations of The New York Times, or about how the Internet is changing said company, you have to give this a read.

As an aside, I remember writing some odds and ends about *newsprint* when I started The Newsprint. I [wrote back then](http://thenewsprint.co/2013/12/14/20131213the-newsprint-an-introduction/):

> Newsprint was the medium then and the blog is the medium now.

While the blog may not be *the* medium now, it’s mind-boggling to think newsprint is still around in the traditional sense of the medium. How long until we talk about recycled newsprint in the same breath as diskettes, audio cassettes, and VHS? Depending on who you talk to, the writing may be on the wall for *actual, tangible* journalism.
