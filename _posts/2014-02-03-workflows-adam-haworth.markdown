<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">But nowadays, these “workflows” (specifically referring to geeky setups, sometimes including automated snippets of code that allow complicated tasks to be done with the click of a button) are everywhere I look. Everyone on my admittedly geek-filled Twitter timeline seems to have at least one thing in their set-up that would make Federico Viticci proud. Meanwhile, I’m staring at my screen, wondering what I’m missing.</em></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I don&#8217;t know if Adam understands what most scripts are meant for. From what he has written, his understanding points to a script as a means to automate a group of tasks and to make work more simple. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But I don&#8217;t think scripts are meant to improve simplicity. They are meant to improve productivity.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">As a bookkeeper by day, I generate customized invoices and purchase orders on a daily basis. I have to create the invoice in our accounting program, generate a PDF, add the customized invoice background to the PDF, change/add text on the PDF and print the PDF. It takes me as much as five minutes to complete this process.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> And what if the invoice needs to be fixed or updated? What a nightmare. I would love a script that completed all of those tasks in a pre-defined order as soon as I hit a specific button.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I don&#8217;t want a script for simplicity. I want a script to <em data-preserve-html-node="true">save time</em>. The more time I save completing time-consuming tasks, the more time I have at the end of the day with my family. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Automation <em data-preserve-html-node="true">is</em> taking away jobs by the day. Why hire someone to complete these cumbersome processes when a script/robot/machine can do the same job quicker? If this is the friction Adam is referring to, I wholeheartedly agree with him. But I don&#8217;t think the correlation between robotic automation and unemployment is what he is discussing.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Automation is used to eliminate simple, time-consuming tasks to make more time for more pressing issues. I think this is efficiency at its finest. </p>
