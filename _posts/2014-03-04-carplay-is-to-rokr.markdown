<blockquote data-preserve-html-node="true">
<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">CarPlay will become much more interesting if and when, say, the millionth CarPlay-equipped car is sold to a customer, which is probably at least two years away even if manufacturer adoption goes very well.</em></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What struck me as odd about this announcement was the fact that <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is not a standalone app. CarPlay won&#8217;t be used by the majority of people. And it certainly won&#8217;t have the &#8220;Apple Effect&#8221; we have come to know and expect.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Who gets to benefit from CarPlay? If the goal is to make interaction with your iPhone safer while driving, why choose such a small target market? Is that effect worth the millions invested? I know exactly <em data-preserve-html-node="true">zero</em> people who are going to buy a brand new car in the next year. The chance of them acquiring CarPlay is probably less than zero.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">CarPlay <em data-preserve-html-node="true">can&#8217;t</em> be meant for such a small group of people. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Unless, <em data-preserve-html-node="true">ahem</em>, <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">Unless</strong>, Apple has something else up its sleeve for CarPlay. If I was a betting man, this would be my guess. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I don&#8217;t know the extent of improvement a standalone app would have on road safety. I don&#8217;t know if Apple would release a standalone device that would improve interaction with an iPhone on the road. And I don&#8217;t know if <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/02/19/teslas-elon-musk-confirms-talks-with-apple-says-acquisition-very-unlikely-at-this-time">Apple views the transportation industry</a> as an industry in need of disruption.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What I do know is Apple has a <em data-preserve-html-node="true">very large</em> number of devices flying down the highway at 60 mph in the hands of unruly drivers. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/25/us-google-glass-lobbying-idUSBREA1O0P920140225">Unlike Google</a>, I can&#8217;t see Apple turning a blind eye to the safety impact of an iPhone. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">CarPlay is a stepping stone to something greater. The <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Rokr">Motorola Rokr</a> seems to faintly come to mind. And we know what came about after that hardware disaster.</p>
