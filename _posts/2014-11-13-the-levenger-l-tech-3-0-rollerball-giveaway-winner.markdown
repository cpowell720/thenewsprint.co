Congratulations [@PearlMom!](https://twitter.com/pearlmom) You have one week to get in touch with me regarding the shipping of your new pen!

Once again, I want to thank the fine folks over at [Levenger.](http://www.levenger.com/l-tech-3.0-rollerball-13202.aspx) Without them, this giveaway would not exist. And more importantly, this beautiful pen would not exist.

Cheers guys! Looking forward to the next giveaway. This was a blast.
