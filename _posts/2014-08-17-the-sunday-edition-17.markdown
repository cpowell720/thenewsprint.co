<p>I&#8217;m Canadian. Which means that many of the problems our southern-neighbours deal with would more than likely not happen here. We have some racial issues as well — especially in the Province of Manitoba — but it&#8217;s not like the racial ordeal in the American South. I&#8217;m not saying the Ferguson problem is petty (because I really have no idea what&#8217;s going on), but Twitter&#8217;s rendition of the riots is nothing short of amusing. I guess this goes to show you shouldn&#8217;t rely on Twitter for all your news updates. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
