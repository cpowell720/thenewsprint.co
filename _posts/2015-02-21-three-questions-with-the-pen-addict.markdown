A few weeks ago, Brad Dowdy asked if I would answer a few questions for his new *Three Questions* interview series on the Pen Addict. [I happily obliged](http://www.penaddict.com/blog/2015/2/21/three-question-with-josh-ginter).

It’s really cool to be a part of Brad’s growing interview series, as there are plenty of skilled and intelligent people who already line its halls. Brad has found a unique way of highlighting other pen and paper writers and I look forward to a new interview each week. 

Thanks for having me Brad!
