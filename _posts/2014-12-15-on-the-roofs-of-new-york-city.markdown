I know, I know â€” I've linked to several On the Roofs posts recently. I apologize for the bombardment of skyscraper photography, especially for those who are afraid of heights. 

However, this one is too good to be true. I never imagined someone could capture New York City in such an awe-inspiring way. 

If I excuse the blip of sponsorship crud in the middle, this is one of my favourite photo blog posts ever.
