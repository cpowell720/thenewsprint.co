I've taken pride in my Field Notes reviews and their accompanying photography over the past year. However, Jinnie's Three Staples blog puts my work to shame. She has excellent photography and keen observances associated with many Field Notes Colors and special editions. Her list of Field Notes reviews far exceeds anything I could ever do. 

This may just become my go-to site for Field Notes reviews and info tidbits in the future.
