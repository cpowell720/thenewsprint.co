  <p><em>It's not yet clear exactly how Google plans to use Nest, but the company obviously sees it as an important part of its future. A combination of Nest's home solutions coupled with Google's language recognition could give Google its strongest path yet into your home. "Google will help us fully realize our vision of the conscious home and allow us to change the world faster than we ever could if we continued to go it alone," writes Fadell on the Nest blog. "We've had great momentum, but this is a rocket ship."</em></p>

<p>Fantastic â€” Google has bought their way into your home. </p>

<p>The tech industry is increasingly oligopolistic. Barriers to entry are difficult to overcome and, assuming those barriers are overcome and success is achieved, the probability of being bought out by those with enormous buying power is nearing 1:1. Every week, we witness another successful startup company bought out by the big guns.</p>

<p>But, at $3.2 billion, who would say no?</p>
