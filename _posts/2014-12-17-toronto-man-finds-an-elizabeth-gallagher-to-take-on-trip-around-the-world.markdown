Jordan Axani and his girlfriend planned an awesome worldwide trip a few months back. When the two broke up, Axani decided to [take to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2l3miz/are_you_named_elizabeth_gallagher_and_canadian/) to find someone who would take his ex-girlfriend's airplane tickets. The lucky winner had to be Canadian and had to be named Elizabeth Gallagher.

Yesterday, Axani chose a winner to join him on a trip of a lifetime. 

For free. 

Lucky duck.
