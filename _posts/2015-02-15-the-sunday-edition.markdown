Most provinces in Canada are enjoying the February long weekend this weekend. In Manitoba, we celebrate the heroic (or traitorous, depending on how you look at the historical situation) Louis Riel. Other provinces celebrate Family Day.

A mid-winter long weekend like this is great and allows for some much needed R&R catchup. In my case, R&R will probably turn into homework. But I can’t complain.

So, Happy Louis Riel day from my home to yours. If you aren’t lucky enough to be in the middle of a long weekend, get into routine and begin the day with the links below.

I was playing around with the Olympus iOS app and used the live view to snap this photo. It was a neat experiment.

Happy Sunday.
