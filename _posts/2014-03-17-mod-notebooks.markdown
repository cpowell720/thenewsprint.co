<p>After developing a <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//the-hybrid-journal">Hybrid Journal</a> system a few weeks ago, I've been steadily documenting my life through the use of <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>, <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> and physical <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> notebooks. Someone must have seen my future and created a product that (almost) fits me perfectly.</p>

<p>The Mod Notebook is a physical notebook that comes with a modern, stylish design. It's made of high quality materials, a flat-laying spine and butter-smooth paper. It looks very similar to journal-style notebooks offered by <a href="http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/classic/">Moleskine</a>.</p>

<p>The selling point, however, is the digital version of Mod Notebooks. Once a Mod Notebook has been filled, you can send the notebook back to Mod with the shipping materials included in your purchase and they will make a digital copy of your notebook. You can view this digital version in an iOS app and Mod will either recycle your physical notebook or send your notebook back to you for safekeeping. Really cool.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why I don't see a Mod Notebook working ideally for the new system I've employed. However, these reasons are easily overcome by both time and product line expansion.</p>

<p>First, Mod Notebooks are larger than Field Notes books, measuring in at 7.7" long by 5.4" wide. This is roughly the same size as an iPad mini and far more difficult to carry around in your pocket.</p>

<p>And second, I have to question whether Mod is a stationery company or a software company. If a stationery company, Mod's development of an iOS app will inherently lag behind the improvement of the physical notebooks. If I invest my time and money into a journaling system that is to last for my entire lifetime, I need to be guaranteed that the iOS application will be supported for a lengthy amount of time as well.</p>

<p>For me, the greatest selling feature of a Mod Notebook is the ability to have digital copies of all my books on my iPhone or iPad. I've already run into situations where I wrote notes in a past Field Notes book which I need to reference, only to find I didn't carry the old notebook with me that day. I love the idea of having a digital copy of all my notebooks on my mobile device.</p>

<p>But, until Mod Notebooks shrink down in size, I'll be waiting. Mod's use of technology is clever and I am looking forward to reading reviews. If they release a 3.5" by 5.5" version, count me in for a test run.</p>
