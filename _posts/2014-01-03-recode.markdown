<p>Next on the tee box, Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher for Re/code. Yes, with the "/" splitting the name.</p>

<p>Mossberg tip-toed his way through No Man's Land and called out all fanboys and fangirls in his first editorial for Re/code. Mossberg, as a renowned tech journalist, remained tepid in his first kick at the Re/code can. I'm surprised, especially considering these first posts mould the personality of the site.</p>

<p>Regardless, I'm excited to see where Re/code goes. Knowing Mossberg and Swisher, it will become a household name soon enough.</p>
