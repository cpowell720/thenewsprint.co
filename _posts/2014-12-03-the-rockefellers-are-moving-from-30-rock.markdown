Sam Roberts for *The New York Times*:

>Although they sat on Rockefeller Center’s board, the sons of John D. Jr. still needed his permission after World War II when they wanted to remodel a portion of the 56th floor into identical 20-by-16-foot offices for each of them.

>“Isn’t this impressive,” Nelson Rockefeller prompted his father, after the renovations were completed.

>To which John D. Jr. supposedly replied, “Nelson, whom are we trying to impress?”

A dash of history, wealth, real estate, and New York City all rolled into one fascinating article. 

And a little side note: I never considered the increased displacement of individuals who work in skyscrapers. I remember my ears popping when heading to the Top of the Rock, but traveling further than the people on the ground never crossed my mind.
