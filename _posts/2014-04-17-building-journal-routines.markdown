<p>Patrick Rhone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact is, we all have existing routines. We all have a set of steps we do every morning, just before bed, or otherwise in our day. These are all opportunities to build in another step and form a new habit. So, if there is something youâ€™ve wanted to do regularly for a long time but have yet to achieve it, this could help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Yes. And more yes.</p>

<p>After starting out our <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//the-hybrid-journal">Hybrid Journal</a> idea, I found myself increasingly annoyed every time I had to write another "Daily Summary". There's no doubt about it: journaling is annoying.</p>

<p>The key is routinizing it. The key is to get to a point where the annoyance is so normal, you wouldn't feel right without doing it. I guess we could call this "Tolerated Annoyance". I'm getting to close to a routinized journal, but I'm not fully there yet.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason I'm not there is because I haven't routinized it as well as Patrick has. His routine building ideas are perfect. They are obvious. They make clear, rational sense. And they are easy to incorporate into daily activities.</p>

<p>Much like Patrick's <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//-a-quick-review-of-the-dashplus-system">Dash Plus system</a>, simplicity emanates from his ideas on building routines. I recommend we all try forming habits and routines with his foundations in mind. </p>
