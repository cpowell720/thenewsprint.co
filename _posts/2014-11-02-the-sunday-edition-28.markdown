I started some link blogging again this past week. Generally I'll leave link posts for links I want to comment on or to pay specific attention to. 

That isn't to say that all the links below aren't incredible. In fact, my jaw dropped a few times when reading and viewing some of the great work this week. 

Enjoy.
