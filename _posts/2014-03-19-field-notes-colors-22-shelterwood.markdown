<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/Coudal/status/445974699319648257">Jim Coudal</a> had alluded to for the last few days, Field Notes Brand released its 22nd limited edition Colors today. </p>

<p>Shelterwood appears to be a first of its kind; its covers are made of a wood veneer from American cherry woods found in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin.</p>

<p>But enough of my stationery giddiness. Head on over and watch the fantastic video. Then order yourself a subscription. That's what <a href="http://jwie.be">Joe</a> and I did. We also added a few Space Pens to take advantage of the incredible new shipping rates.</p>

<p>Shelterwood is simply jaw-dropping.</p>
