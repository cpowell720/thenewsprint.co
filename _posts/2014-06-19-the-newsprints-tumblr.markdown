Bear with me as I input a tiny plug.

I just bought this [pretty cool camera](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-mirrorless-camera-under-1000/) and a [pretty cool lens](http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2013/08/23/the-panasonic-20-1-7-ii-lens-on-the-olympus-e-p5/). And I really, **really** want to post my photos somewhere. 

Flickr is cool. Instagram is cool.

But I like Tumblr more. 

So, as an addition to the content you'll find here, you can also check out The Newsprint's new Tumblelog. It'll be plastered with photos and some other stuff I want to collect. 

That's probably the best way of describing The Newsprint's Tumblelog. It'll be a collection of other stuff that really has nothing to do with pens, paper, tools and apps. 

Or maybe it will. Whatever.

[Take a peak](http://thenewsprintco.tumblr.com) if you feel like being awesome.
