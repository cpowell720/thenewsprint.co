  <p><em>This post might be ephemerally tweeted by dozens of avatars I might or might not recognize, accumulate a number in a database that represents the “hits” it had, and if I’m lucky might even get some comments, but when I get caught up in that the randomness of what becomes popular or generates commentary and what doesn’t it invariably leads me to write less. So blog just for two people.</em></p>

<p>Writing for the Internet is open season; putting your thoughts and opinions online inherits scrutiny and praise. When the formula is right, people love you. When the formula is wrong, some people can redefine the term "critical".</p>

<p>Matt has a sensational piece of advice about writing online for others. Writing for two people not only eliminates the insatiable need to satisfy everyone, it also helps to define a topic and thesis. </p>
