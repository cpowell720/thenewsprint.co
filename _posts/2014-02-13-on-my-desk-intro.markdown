<p>A couple weeks ago, Chris Gonzalez over at <a href="http://unretrofied.com">Unretrofied.com</a> began curating a series of interviews with some well known online personalities. The series discusses the objects they carry around on a daily basis and what they throw in their bag every morning.  I <strong>love</strong> <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/category/sweet-setup-interview/">these</a> <a href="http://macsparky.com/?tag=home+screens#show-archive">types</a> of <a href="http://unretrofied.com/?category=Artifacts">series</a>. They give a neat look into how other people do their work and they offer new ways to improve how we do our own work.</p>

<p>These series outline objects people carry while on the go and software applications people use on their devices. However, I have yet to find a curation of products which people use while sitting at their desk. Our jobs are increasingly office-oriented which forces users to work within the confines of a small desk and an even smaller chair. I want to know how people cope with office life, which products they swear by, which products improve their life, and which products offer unique ways to finish a job or task.  </p>

<p>This is a <em>very</em> broad topic and there is no chance I'll be able to outline entire workspaces. I want to review one or two products at a time using some photography to showcase the product and some positive writing to spread the word. I'll let <a href="http://thewirecutter.com">The Wirecutter</a>, <a href="http://thesweethome.com">The Sweethome</a> and <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com">The Sweet Setup</a> inform you on <em>the best</em> products. I want to discuss items that work best <em>for you</em> â€” sometimes, the best products on the market don't apply appropriately for everyone. I love learning about new and different products and I want to share those products with you.</p>

<p>I'll start off my series in the next few days with one of my favourite pens. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the series. If you ever want to let me know about a product you really enjoy, please don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co/contact/">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for reading,</p>
