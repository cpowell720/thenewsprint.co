I'm back in action. 

Sorry for the hiatus this past weekend. Rare is the day where The Sunday Edition goes unpublished, but rarer is the day that I don't have an internet connection. It's one thing to turn off your smartphone's connection from email for a weekend. It's an entirely different thing to have *no* internet connection at all.

With that out of the way, let's hope I can round up a busy 10 days. I have undoubtedly missed some important pieces that deserve recognition, so that will garner a second apology from me.
