It's been somewhat difficult to hold back my opinions on [9to5Mac's major unveiling of the 12" MacBook Air](http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/). The design looks amazing and the stripping of I/O ports appears to be a unique decision. If Apple is able to bring the retina display to the 21.5" iMac, the summer will shape up to be a monumental hit on our pocketbooks.

With that article in mind, you'll find a couple Apple links below which outline some thoughts on the purported 12" Air. 

Lastly, I've fallen prey this past week to immense gear lust. I vowed this would never take hold of me, but here I am eyeing up another Olympus lens. Someone send help.
