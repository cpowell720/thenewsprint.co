From the [Richmond Golf Club](http://therichmondgolfclub.com) in Surrey, England in 1940:

> A player whose stroke is affected by the simultaneous explosion of a bomb may play another ball from the same place. Penalty, one stroke.

This sounds a little more problematic than a [fan yelling "mashed potatoes](http://youtu.be/Sp4muT299Ns)".
