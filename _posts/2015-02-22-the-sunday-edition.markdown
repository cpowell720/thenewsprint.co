I should probably stop complaining about the cold after hearing about the frigid temperatures on the east coast of North America. My heart reaches out to you folks.

The Sunday Edition has continued to grow, both in length and readership, over the last few months. This is becoming my favourite article to complete each week, but reading all the links in full can take a fair chunk of time. Take The New Yorker's feature on Jonny Ive for example — at 17,000 words, you're going to need two cups of coffee before you get through it all. 

Either way, I hope you continue to find some great writing in this week's Sunday Edition.
