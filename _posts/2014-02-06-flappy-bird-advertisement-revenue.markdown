<p>You know those unbearable flashing advertisements you have to click through every time you die? Turns out there is a reason they are added to the game.</p>

<p>The math adds to $350,000 a week, or $1,500,000 a month or $18,250,000 a year.</p>

<p>That's <em>a lot</em> of revenue, especially for a <em>free</em> game.</p>
