I’m scared of heights. Not *knees-shaking-and-stomach-churning* scared of heights, but, well, scared of heights. Despite my fear, these photos are still mind-blowingly awesome. As the photographer states, New York’s grid is reminiscent of brain synapses — neurons firing right, left, and center. Gorgeous.
 
I also had no idea helicopters could fly this high. After [further investigation](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=maximum%20height%20of%20helicopter), they can go far higher yet.
