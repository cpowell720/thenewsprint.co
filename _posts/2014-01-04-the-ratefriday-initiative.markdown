  <p><em>So I thought that #RateFriday would be a good way to kill two birds with one stone:</em></p>
  
  <p><em>・Encourage developers that create apps I enjoy and use.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>・Let other people know about those great apps.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Word of mouth is a very powerful marketing tool as we tend to trust people when they suggest a product that they actually use themselves. When an app makes my life easier, I want everyone to know about it so that they can benefit from it as well!</em></p>

<p>Whatever your phone of choice, developers try to make a living by creating nifty and enjoyable software. Spread the love every Friday by quickly rating your most used apps. </p>
