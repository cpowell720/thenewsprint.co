<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My wife and I chose New York City as our honeymoon destination. Our hotel was a block from Columbus Circle, which meant I had to venture into the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/moleskine-usa-store-ipo_b27698">first Moleskine store</a> in the United States. Obviously I couldn&#8217;t just look. I had to buy. And I came home with a pen I use every day.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Moleskine Light Metal Roller Pen is the first high end<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> pen I have ever purchased. The pen came in a svelte box which could not duplicate the elegance of what was inside. The weight to the pen felt right in my hand and rolled perfectly on the Moleskine Cahier I bought alongside. The pen and paper were made for each other.</p>

<p></div></p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image.jpeg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I proceeded to work through three ink refills in the next four months, increasing the cost of my "super expensive" pen. I had been a fan of the 0.5mm line until my recent Amazon blunder â€” when the 0.7mm refill arrived, my mistake turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The 0.7mm refills yield a smoother roll and a more comfortable glide across the paper but can be blotchy at times. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll go back to the thinner line. Despite the friction of the 0.5mm and the spotty 0.7mm, I&#8217;ve been a happy writer. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My Light Metal Roller may be <em data-preserve-html-node="true">slightly</em> defective, however. The pen&#8217;s lid has no sense of commitment to the rest of the pen&#8217;s body, meaning it has narrowly avoided losing its head countless times. I don&#8217;t know if this is representative of the entire product line but the lid&#8217;s ease of removal has caught me by surprise. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-2.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">Removing an empty ink cartridge is simple and has taught me to value a specific pen. I choose not to haul the pen around everywhere I go as my prized honeymoon souvenir is safer on my desk than on the go.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> When at my desk, putting pen to memo book creates a more intimate passage than jotting notes in my phone. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Despite its problems and its relative cost, the Moleskine Light Metal Roller introduced me to the world of stationery. I never fathomed the idea of wasting paper and ink when writing notes. Once I bought this pen, my thoughts <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//giving-up-on-digital-notes">changed</a>. It may not be the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-pen/">best pen in the world</a><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>, but it created a new respect for the written word and the tools which create them. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For this reason, and for the inevitable fact of it being a honeymoon souvenir<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a>, I keep the Moleskine Light Metal Roller Pen on my desk. </p>
