<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://svbtle.com">Svbtle</a> is a blogging network that hit the web about a year ago. I was <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://joshuaginter.com/a-new-start-for-my-personal-page">recently invited</a> and enjoyed the short exclusivity. But frankly, the platform is far too good to be invite-only.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://thetypist.com/369/svbtle-now-open-everyone/">The Typist</a> wrote a good article outlining the difference between <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> and Svbtle. He correctly explains that Medium is to the magazine as Svbtle is to the blog. Medium is more of a social network where writers can publish their beautiful stories without their own domain.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> Svbtle, on the other hand, is your own personal site — like Tumblr, complete with your own domain but free of the social network aspect.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Svbtle is also free of a purchase price, which is potentially the most profound characteristic of Svbtle.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Of the free blogging platforms like Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr and the likes, Svbtle offers the most <em data-preserve-html-node="true">simple</em> experience. Yes, it&#8217;s less customizable than Wordpress or Tumblr,<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> but that&#8217;s not what Svbtle is shooting for. It shoots for a simple workflow for developing ideas into publishable pieces. I personally find Svbtle to be the most <em data-preserve-html-node="true">humane</em> blogging platform I have used — and I&#8217;ve used them all.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My friend Joe, who customized my <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//welcome-bigfoot">Bigfoot footnotes</a>, quickly hopped over to Svbtle <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://jwie.be">as well</a>. Joe has incredible <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://collectif.co">design taste</a> and his switching to Svbtle says a great deal. I recommend you keep an eye on his work.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I also recommend you create a Svbtle blog of your own immediately. It&#8217;s free. It&#8217;s beautiful. And it&#8217;s as human as you can get for a blogging platform. </p>
