<p>While I eagerly await my newly-purchased subscription package, I recommend heading over to <a href="http://edjelley.com">Ed Jelley's</a> awesome stationery site to view some fantastic photos of Shelterwood. After seeing Ed's photos, I'm pleasantly surprised to see the heavier, ruled paper bring out a natural sentiment. </p>

<p>And while you're roaming Ed's site, be sure to check out his review of the <a href="http://edjelley.com/2013/10/09/field-notes-drink-local-edition-2013/">Drink Local edition</a>, the <a href="http://edjelley.com/2013/12/06/field-notes-county-fair-review/?relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=3040&amp;relatedposts_position=0">County Fair edition</a> and the small review of the <a href="http://edjelley.com/2014/01/31/field-notes-colors-edition-update-and-why-i-now-like-orange/?relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=3040&amp;relatedposts_position=2">India Pale Ale book</a>. His photography brings out the beauty of these books in a way no other person on the Internet has pulled off.  </p>
