I've spent an inordinate amount of time studying investments and the stock market this week, and it turns out that "buying low and selling high" really is the name of the game. If The Newsprint was a public company, you would have bought high and sold low. For that, I apologize.

However, as the snow begins to fly here in Southern Manitoba, The Sunday Edition has tended to get longer. More (and longer) links should take up more of your couch time on these blustery Sunday afternoons. 

This week, you may want to put aside time for *A Birth Story* (14,250 words) and *“He Hits Me Because He Loves Me”*. I had a hard time reading the latter article. Very well written.
