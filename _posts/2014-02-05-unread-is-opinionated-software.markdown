title: Unread Is Opinionated Software

<p>When <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a> launched last year, developers <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, <a href="http://betterelevation.com/">Dave Wiskus</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a> described the app as <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/how-to-make-a-vesper/">"opinionated software"</a>. I feel that ever since Vesper's introduction, finding an opinionated combination of capability, design and usability has been a <a href="http://writer.pro">feverish trend</a>. Eliminating features and making design choices in favour of simplicity can be touchy but extremely effective when done right. </p>

<p>Unread is also opinionated software. And it's opinionated software done right. </p>

<p>Some will choose not to like this. Some will swear by it. So far, I'm somewhere in between. </p>

<p>Unread definitely sheds the power-user mentality of <a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> and <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">Mr. Reader</a>, but that doesn't mean Unread is featureless. If anything, Unread is just as powerful. It's just powerful in a far different way. </p>

<p>Unread has changed how I read my RSS feed. And, more importantly, Unread <em>finally</em> entrenches the divide between Twitter and RSS. </p>

<p>I have always experienced a large duplication between Twitter and RSS. I followed my favourite writers in both and I followed my favourite news sites in both. This led to double the effort in weeding through all of my favourite content.</p>

<p>After I installed Unread two nights ago, I immediately realized this duality. The little devil on my left shoulder yearned not to delete my oldest subscriptions. But why keep an RSS subscription of a feed that breaks news on Twitter? Reeder allowed me to quickly skim through these feeds and mark all as read <em>too easily</em>. Unread quickly corrected that.</p>

<p>This is the effect of simplified software. It seemed so obvious upon opening Unread that my RSS feed was bloated. </p>

<p>This isn't to say that I'm eliminating Reeder from my RSS arsenal. In fact, it probably won't even leave my home screen. But I finally know <em>how</em> to use Reeder. Alongside Tweetbot and Unread, I have a strong content consumption workflow. </p>

<p>And all it took was some opinionated software.</p>
