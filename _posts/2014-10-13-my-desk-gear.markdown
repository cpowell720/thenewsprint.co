Shawn Blanc invited me to show off my desk gear over at the newly revamped Tools and Toys. My gear is fairly average, but the focus on analog tools may surprise some (and will not surprise others).

Head over to [Tools and Toys](http://toolsandtoys.net) to check it out!

P.S. I think you should just stay peeled to Tools and Toys over the next few weeks. My gut feeling says they've got some incredible stuff planned for the rest of October.
