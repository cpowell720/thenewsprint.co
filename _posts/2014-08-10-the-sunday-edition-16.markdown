<p>It has been a fairly retrospective morning. A young man I coached a few years ago died yesterday. I&#8217;m going to miss watching him on the ball field, but I know he&#8217;s in a better place. </p>

<p>I want to pass thoughts and prayers on to his family and, specifically, his father. No man should ever have to bury their son.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>This Sunday Edition goes out to any father or mother who have had to do this. You are more courageous than I could ever hope to be.</p>
