He holds three patents for things like a modular space station, and he started a foundation devoted to advancing space education. "But this is not what you want to talk about," he thankfully says, and so you say let's get back to that day you went to the moon. It was a moment for the world, a particular historic moment when scientific, military, and nationalistic interests intersected perfectlyâ€”and him and Neil and Mike blasting off atop a Saturn V as if in celebration of that perfect union. And doesn't he have a perspective on that? A way of thinking about that?
