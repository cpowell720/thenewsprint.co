I carry one of two bags on a daily basis: the [Booq Mamba Courier](http://thenewsprint.co/2014/08/19/booq-mamba-courier/) or the Booq Mamba Slim Courier. The first is used if I have a slightly larger load to carry, while the second is used for carrying only the essentials. Over on Tools & Toys, I reviewed the latter of the two options â€” [the Booq Mamba Slim Courier.](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/booq-mamba-slim-courier-bag/)

The Slim Courier is super slim and super light. It carries an iPad, a few pens and notebooks, and some documents extremely well. Anything bulkier, though, and you may want to check something else out. 

If you don't carry a whole lot on a daily basis, the Booq Mamba Slim Courier is a great everyday carry choice.
