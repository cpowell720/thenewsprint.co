Kai Brach, publisher of the widely read [Offscreen Magazine](http://www.offscreenmag.com/), has recently created a newsletter that aims to highlight awesome products he stumbles upon each week.
 
His [first issue](http://createsend.com/t/r-31C621CA3F6AE6DD2540EF23F30FEDED) almost has me pushing the buy button already. Between the [StandStand](https://grandst.com/preorder/standstand) and the [Moment iPhone Camera Case](http://momentlens.co/), I’m thinking Kai’s taste in products will make this an anxiously awaited newsletter in my email inbox each week.
