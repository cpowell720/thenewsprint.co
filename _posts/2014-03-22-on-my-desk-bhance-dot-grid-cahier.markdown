<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">This is the first of (hopefully) many posts by my good friend <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://jwie.be">Josiah Wiebe</a>. Josiah has a wealth of experience in design and tech. He runs a new — and ultra-talented — design startup, works as a web developer and is a certified Apple Technician. Josiah also has a keen interest in stationery tools. Evidently, we share almost every interest.</em></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">I look forward to having Josiah post a few of his experiences going forward. As I talk to him on a daily basis, I&#8217;ve realized I can&#8217;t be the only person who benefits from his passion for great tools.</em> </p>

<hr data-preserve-html-node="true"><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/behancedotgridcahier.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I&#8217;ve always been a bit of a sucker for notebooks. Anything you can write in really. My collection of journals, notebooks and memo books is constantly growing, most recently with a subscription to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>; after seeing <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/shelterwood/">Shelterwood</a> I was quick to split a subscription with Josh.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">When <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://jondueck.ca/">Jon</a> and I started <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://collectif.co">Collectif</a>, we used the Bēhance network to share the majority of our work before we had a website and <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://dribbble.com/josiahwiebe">Dribbble</a>. Part of their business was Action Method<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>, which was &#8220;a system for productivity in the creative world.&#8221; Part of Action Method was a series of great looking dot grid notebooks, so Jon and I figured we&#8217;d give it a shot. Since then, every <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://collectif.co">Collectif</a> project has started out in a Bēhance dot grid notebook of sorts.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lookatthatbokeh.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">I&#8217;m not quick to spite Field Notes, but they don&#8217;t come close to the feeling of quality you get with the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.theghostlystore.com/collections/behance-action-method/products/behance-dot-grid-cahier">Dot Grid Cahier</a>. There&#8217;s a few reasons for this.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Dot Grid Cahier has 64 pages, almost one and a half times that of Field Notes' 48 pages. This gives the whole notebook a sturdier feeling. The pages as a whole are also a little bit larger; Field Notes are 3&#8211;1/2&#8220; x 5&#8211;1/2&#8221; while the Cahier is an even 4&#8220; x 6&#8221;.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Instead of three staples, the Dot Grid Cahier is stitch bound, which feels sturdy. All of the pages are perforated about 5mm from the binding, so you can easily take a handful of ideas out of the book.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/morebokeh.jpg" /><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The actual paper is 100% New Leaf Sustainable 162gsm paper, which is a little bit rough, but for pencils — my preferred writing tool — it’s ideal. As the name states, the paper is covered in a dot grid. In my opinion, this is much preferred over standard graph paper. The subtlety of it allows for sketches without too much interference, while the dots keep you straight for writing.</p><div class="intrinsic" style="max-width:100%"><div class="embed-block-wrapper" style="padding-bottom:75.0%;"><div class="sqs-video-wrapper" data-html="&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/89792917?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; title=&quot;MVI 5009&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" data-provider-name="Vimeo"><div class="sqs-video-overlay" style="opacity: 0;"><img data-src="http://localhost:8888/wp.thenewsprint.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4998.jpg" data-load="false" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" /><div class="sqs-video-opaque"></div><div class="sqs-video-icon"></div></div></div></div></div><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The cover stock isn’t actually specified, but it’s a nice thick kraft with a beautifully embossed title on the front. I’ve had mine for a number of months and I’ve thrown it into my pocket and into my pack on countless occasions. It’s held up really well.</p><p data-preserve-html-node="true">The Bēhance Dot Grid Cahier is a beautiful and rugged notebook that’s an economical alternative to Field Notes. The only thing it is missing is the Field Notes culture.</p><div data-preserve-html-node="true" class="footnotes">
