I’m with [Stephen on this one](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/3/microsoft-launches-office-2016-for-mac-preview): Tons of people are going to write off Office for Mac 2016 because it’s an Office product. But, again in agreement with Stephen, working in a cross-platform world demands Office use.

I spend hours every day in Excel. I truly feel it is the greatest single application ever conceived. Until now, Excel for Mac has been an utter joke — I’ve resorted to using it sparingly for reviewing worksheets instead of editing and creating worksheets. Excel for Mac 2016 looks *vastly* improved and I can’t wait to get my hands on it.

Oh, and Outlook has been updated. Bye-bye Mail.app?
