<p>This is an exciting time for The Newsprint. </p>

<p>The little advertisement you see in the corner represents the first product I've ever sold. That's what this is after all. Whether someone pays for a good or receives a good for free, there is still a form of exchange. I jot down flawless prose and you, dear Reader, give your undivided attention. Seems like a fair deal. </p>

<p>And I don't think that's so bad. In fact, I think we are <em>always</em> selling ourselves, no matter the situation. My boss once said that salesmanship is necessary for <em>every</em> occupation, not just retail. It could not be more true for publishers.</p>

<p>For now, the once little white space in the corner will be filled with a well-designed square of awesomeness. <a href="http://carbonads.net">Carbon Ads</a> has been an absolute pleasure to work with and I'm very proud to be one of their publishing members.</p>

<p>What does this mean to you, my Readers? Absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>My Readers are some of the classiest, smartest and best looking Readers on the planet. My Readers rock. I would never do anything to jeopardize my relationship with them. </p>

<p>I want to welcome Carbon Ads to The Newsprint's halls of infamy. And I want to thank my Readers for making it a reality. </p>

<p>To all involved, thank you.</p>
