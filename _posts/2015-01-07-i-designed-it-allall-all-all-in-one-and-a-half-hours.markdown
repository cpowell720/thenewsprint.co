Phillipe Starck’s version of how [Steve Jobs’ yacht](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(yacht)) was designed bears some discrepancies with Walter Isaacson’s biography. It’s widely known that Isaacson’s [biography is riddled with mistakes](http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs), so this story comes down to a *his-word-against-mine* spat.

Beautiful things can be created when two minds as great as these team up. Too bad it has to end sourly.
