Jekyll blogs appear to be in demand in my little circle these days. The simple waterfall blog approach is very desirable, but the back-end work to get up and running is daunting.

That's why I hired Josiah. What [you see here was custom built](http://thenewsprint.co/2014/12/01/year-two/) by Josiah in not much more than a weekend.

If you're curious about Josiah's process, or if you're curious about the transition from Ghost to Jekyll, you should check out his rundown of the work for The Newsprint. Half of the article is in a language I don't understand, but that doesn't mean it won't be extremely helpful for someone else. 

**Update** â€” Oh, and those Editorial workflows are awesome. In fact, they are the only way I post to the site. Building a post with images is done via Byword on the Mac or Editorial on the iPad. From there, it gets published via the iPad. So simple. So easy to use.
