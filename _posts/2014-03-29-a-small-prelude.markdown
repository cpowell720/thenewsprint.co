<p>After finishing the first draft of my Shelterwood review, I strongly feel you should be well acquainted with Brad Dowdy's latest Pen Addict podcast. </p>

<p>Yes, he and <a href="http://mykehurley.net">Myke Hurley</a> argue. It's slightly humourous actually.</p>

<p>But Brad's opinion of the new Field Notes is spot on. Jump to the 26:00 mark and listen for 15 minutes. You'll get the gist of his attitude toward Shelterwood and you'll probably end up buying a pack just to prove him wrong.</p>

<p>I wish you good luck in your spiteful endeavours, however. By now, you should know better than to argue with a specialist.</p
