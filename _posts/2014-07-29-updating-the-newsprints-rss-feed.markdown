title: Updating The Newsprint's RSS Feed

I've gone ahead and updated The Newsprint's RSS feed to one of [Feedpress's offerings](http://feedpress.it). Thanks to [Josiah's craftsmanship](http://jwie.be), The Newsprint's RSS feed should now be analysis-ready for the first time in the site's existence. 

I'll boldly ask all RSS subscribers to switch over to the new feed. If you decide to, great. If not, I'm pretty sure the old feed will still be operational.

If you're not sure of how to unsubscribe from The Newsprint's old feed and subscribe to the new feed, Josiah created this cool GIF to show how to update the feed in Reeder 2 for iOS. 

Thanks again for making the update to the new RSS feed. And thanks again Josiah for your continued help.
