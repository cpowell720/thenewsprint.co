<p>Twitter is super cool. One minute, you're surfing. The next, someone is pinging you with excellent content. This may be awful for some people, but yesterday's tweet literally brightened my day. </p>

<p>Andy Hullinger of <a href="http://www.yippeecahier.net">Yippee Cahier</a> sent me a link regarding the effect of sunlight on raw wood used to build furniture. It's fascinating.</p>

<p>But it's even more fascinating when you watch Andy apply this aging process — along with a little wood stain — to Field Notes' new Shelterwood memo books. </p>

<p>If you thought Shelterwood was the most beautiful memo book on the market, think again. Stained Shelterwood is the new thing. </p>

<p>Head on over and check out this really cool video. </p>
