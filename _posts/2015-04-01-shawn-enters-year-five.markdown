I’ve tried to emulate Shawn and his work ever since I started The Newsprint. I’ll never live up to his standard of integrity, but I deem it honourable to try. It’s gratifying to know that honesty, integrity, and humility can still make it in this world.
 
Congratulations Shawn on four years of full-time writing. Tons of people look up to you, and for good reason. Here’s to many more.
