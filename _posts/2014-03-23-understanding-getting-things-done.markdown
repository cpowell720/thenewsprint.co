<p>If you're like me and assumed "GTD" was a homogenous term for "doing stuff", this Sunday link may help enlighten your ways. Call me ignorant, but I never fully understood that "Getting Things Done" was designed by David Allen for productivityists like me.</p>

<p>Now that I know about his five step system, apps like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a>, <a href="http://www.appigo.com/todo-task-and-to-do-list.html">Todo</a>, and <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/">Things</a> make a lot more sense. </p>

<p>And, if anything, I'm more convinced apps like that are not meant for me.</p>

<p>As David Allen outlines in his five step process, every GTD process needs a tool to capture any and all thoughts, ideas and tasks before delegating each to their appropriate placement. For some people, a capture tool may be an app like <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> or <a href="http://gokarbon.com/scratch/">Scratch</a>. For others, an Omnifocus inbox does the trick. </p>

<p>For people like me, a good old notebook fits the bill. After writing down thoughts and ideas, I can type appropriate tasks into <a href="http://builtbysnowman.com/checkmark/">Checkmark</a> or into <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone">Fantastical</a> or I can use my book to check off tasks as I get them done. </p>

<p>Of everything I've learned recently about digital vs. analog task management, the most glaring fact is that there is no particular catch-all process. Everyone truly has their own best method for getting things done. David Allen's five step process is simple and can be applied to many different workflows. But it still might not fit you perfectly.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy your relaxing Sunday. If reading about "Getting Things Done" is not your idea of a relaxing Sunday, then please excuse everything I just said.</p>
