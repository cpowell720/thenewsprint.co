I received the first of two Field Notes packages headed my way yesterday evening and I couldn't help but snap some photos. I've had a hard time finding photos online that show some Arts & Sciences specifics, so I figured I would get these into the wild.

Here's to hoping for a review sometime next week!

Enjoy!

Words may not properly describe how *big* Arts & Sciences are. Despite all the press release photos, I wasn't prepared for the initial shock. These are definitely *not* pocket memo books.

The most familiar object I can compare to the size of Arts & Sciences is the iPad mini. Hopefully my hand in this shot reflects the size.

The logo debossing is as good as it gets.

I'm willing to bet the research for the inside covers took as long as the design of the book itself.
