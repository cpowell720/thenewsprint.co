Apparently I [made the right choice](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-mirrorless-camera-under-1000/).

Also, and I continue to say it, I'm blown away by the power of Wi-Fi in a camera. As The Wirecutter states, Olympus has (mostly) nailed how to do Wi-Fi properly with the E-M10. 

Snap > Connect > Save to Camera Roll > VSCOcam > Flickr/Instagram. 

So simple and so efficient. I insisted on buying a camera with Wi-Fi capabilities, but I never expected Wi-Fi would become my most used feature.

Lastly, I love experimenting with the E-M10's HDR feature. I've never had a camera that stitches the images together in-house. This might be widespread by now, but it's the first time I've tried in-house HDR. Gotta say, I really like the option for extreme exposures.
