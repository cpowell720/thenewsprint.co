<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><em data-preserve-html-node="true">The algorithm, a software tool that draws on “Lion King” data for 11.5 million audience members so far, recommends prices for five different types of performances — peak dates like Christmas, off-peak dates like a weeknight in February, and periods in between. Ticket demand from mid-March in recent years, for instance, will influence price recommendations for this week.</em></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My wife and I were lucky enough to see <em data-preserve-html-node="true">The Lion King</em> at the Minskoff on our honeymoon. It was absolutely phenomenal. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And it&#8217;s equally cool to know that we were part of the algorithmic pricing scheme Disney has employed to increase sales. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What confuses me is the fact that this algorithm is considered an innovation in the Broadway Musical industry. Isn&#8217;t it common sense to apply big data algorithms to ticket pricing in <em data-preserve-html-node="true">every</em> industry? To learn that this is a new pricing tactic is about as surprising as <em data-preserve-html-node="true">The Lion King</em> topping 2013 sales charts.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Whatever the case, if you&#8217;re heading to New York for any reason (and you aren&#8217;t a New Yorker to begin with), I would recommend heading down to the Minskoff sometime in the middle of the week in April. Tickets will be as cheap as ever<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and your breath will be taken away.</p>
