Well that was certainly a fun week. From a lengthy [Field Notes review](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/06/16/field-notes-arts-and-sciences/), to the awesome [Pen Addict podcast](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/06/17/pen-addict-podcast-episode-111/), to another [pen review](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/06/20/pilot-g2-extra-fine-retractable-pen/), I was busy. I can't wait to talk further this week about the item making all this imagery possible.

Anyhow, here's some other great material that caught my eye throughout the week.

* The Wrong Camera -- [(The Online Photographer)](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2014/06/the-wrong-camera.html)

* The Five Coolest Spacecraft in Science Fiction -- [(Crate of Penguins)](http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/five-coolest-spacecraft)

* Lamy 2000 Fountain Pen - Fine Nib (Makrolon) -- [(The Clicky Post)](http://clickypost.com/blog/2014/6/16/lamy-2000-fountain-pen-fine-nib-makrolon)

* On Interruptions -- [(The Brooks Review)](https://brooksreview.net/2014/06/on-interruptions/)

* Sitting Is Bad For You. So I Stopped. For a Whole Month. -- [(Dan Kois - New York Magazine)](http://nymag.com/health/bestdoctors/2014/sitting-down-2014-6/)

That seems like a well-rounded list. There's even a smattering of controversy.

Happy Sunday!
