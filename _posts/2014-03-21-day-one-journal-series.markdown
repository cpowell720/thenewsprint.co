<p>Since <a href="http://www.thenewsprint.co//the-hybrid-journal">discussing a way</a> to incorporate both a physical and digital journal into the same process, a few people have asked about the <em>kind</em> of material to record in a journal. I have my own process fairly well figured out, but my process may not fit your own style. </p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tuliojarocki">Tulio Jarocki</a> has a great journaling series that outlines how to develop journaling habits, what to journal and why to journal. He also has a <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/2014/03/the-way-i-journal-chris-bowler/">great interview series</a> where he discusses how normal people go about recording their own lives. </p>

<p>I find myself reading all of Tulio's work. I've learned many techniques to add to my own process and it's fun to read about how <em>normal</em> people journal.</p>

<p>I can't wait to see what Tulio comes up with for Article #5. Automation and templates are two topics I'm extremely fascinated with and maybe he can shed some light on new ways to spruce up my Day One.</p>
