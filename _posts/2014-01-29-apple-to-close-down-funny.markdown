<blockquote>
<p><em>Analysts reacted positively to Cook’s statement, noting that while, in the short term, Apple shutting down entirely was not a positive step, it would finally provide plenty of room for meteoric growth should the company decide to reopen again at some point in the future. In after-hours trading, AAPL was up 37 per cent.</em></p>

<p>I don’t understand how analysts, like the ones <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/28/apple-results-idUSL2N0L11SK20140128">at Reuters,</a> can find work.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>Why do stocks slide when reports show record breaking revenue and record breaking profit? Despite my schooling, I have yet to understand this.</p>
