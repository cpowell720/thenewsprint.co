<blockquote data-preserve-html-node="true">
<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Moleskine has begun to market itself as being at the forefront of the “analog-digital continuum.” In 2013, it subtly revised the story in the booklet that comes with its products: “Moleskine accompanies the creative and imaginative professions of our time: it represents, around the world, a symbol of contemporary nomadism, closely connected with the digital world.” This has a very utopian ring, but it’s sort of hard to tell what exactly it means.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In April, 2013, Moleskine went public in Italy, the first I.P.O. to enter the Milan bourse in over a year. It positioned itself not as a stationery brand but as a luxury-goods company—the reasoning being that “luxury goods” sounds much better to investors than “stationery.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I understand that Moleskine may be of higher quality and have a well-conceived brand image, but too many things work against Moleskine in achieving this image.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First, and correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but &#8220;luxury&#8221; and &#8220;ubiquity&#8221; rarely go hand-in-hand. Luxury, to me, means high quality and unique ownership.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> By this definition, if a product can be found at most retail stores and if many people use the product, luxury is eliminated from the get-go. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Second, luxury isn&#8217;t luxury without design genius. If a product is over — or under — designed, the product can&#8217;t be luxurious. The product must emit <em data-preserve-html-node="true">comfort</em> in order to be luxurious. </p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So, in that regard, I don&#8217;t know if Moleskine&#8217;s digital attempts are the future of &#8220;digital stationery&#8221;. Nor do I believe Moleskine&#8217;s version of digital stationery is luxurious. If anything, having to take a photo of each page adds a step to the process and makes books convoluted and complex. Writing notes and keeping a journal need to stay simple so as to maintain routine and eliminate friction. I think <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://modnotebooks.com">Mod Notebooks</a> are on a better track to introduce the digital to the analog, but even their model may be flawed.<a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> Friction and complexity do not exude comfort and, as a result, eliminate luxury.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Moleskine is by no means missing the mark — they are experiencing revenue growth year over year. One has to wonder, though, about how missions, visions and values work for or against the company&#8217;s goals. If Moleskine defines itself to impress investors, yet releases a product line inconsistent with that vision, at what point does the two-facedness hinder quality and value?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">A house divided usually falls. For Moleskine&#8217;s sake, I sure hope it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The best argument against this is Apple&#8217;s iPhone. Many would consider the iPhone to be a luxury product. Apple certainly shoots to put the iPhone into the hands of every person on the planet. However, if every person <em data-preserve-html-node="true">did</em> have an iPhone, would you look at your own iPhone as a luxury good? Would you feel that <em data-preserve-html-node="true">your</em> iPhone emits comfort, extravagance and elegance (the very definition of the word &#8220;luxury&#8221;) in the same manner as if you were the <em data-preserve-html-node="true">only</em> person on the planet who owned an iPhone? I don&#8217;t think so. Exclusivity is paramount to the perception of luxury. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The very thought of having to ship the notebook away for a few weeks before receiving a digital copy is petrifying to me. My journals and notebooks are a collection of personal thoughts and ideas. Putting those books in the hands of some digitizing jockey may lead to my &#8220;brilliant&#8221; ideas plastered in the bathroom stall. This isn&#8217;t my idea of a perfect plan. At least not yet. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
