<p>Lessley Anderson writing for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The urge to join groups is a natural human desire. Evolutionarily speaking, our babies fared better if we surrounded ourselves with helping hands. But even today when you can survive as a loner, there’s something intoxicating about being part of an experience that’s larger than oneself.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Politics, religion, sports, bands — these are the tents under which we typically congregate. Allah, Judas Priest, the Cubs, sure. But smartphones? It seems sort of hard to believe that a graham cracker-sized computer that’s supposed to be a tool, a means to an end, could somehow deliver the same level of ecstatic experience. That it could be powerful enough to feel like a movement.</em></p>

<p>Some of these people are nuts. And ironically enough, they don't outline the perceived insanities of an Apple fanboy. Weird.</p>
