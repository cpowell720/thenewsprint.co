This is a bit of an old thread from Hacker News, but the comments are fascinating.
 
If you stumbled upon a major cash windfall, what would you do? Would you quit your job, take a vacation, buy a new house, and play on the beach? Or would you live off the interest, make sound investments, and volunteer your time?
 
The little devil on my shoulder would tell me to take a vacation and buy a Herman Miller Lounge Chair, while the little angel would tell me to give it all away. I’d love to think I would be an altruist with a major windfall, but let’s get real.
 
*As a side note, excuse some of the verbiage in this thread – the general idea is what I want to share, not the excessive use of informal language.*
