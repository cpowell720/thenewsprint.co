<p>I came across the <a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/tr/english/">Midori Traveler's Notebook</a> while researching ways to carry around multiple Field Notes books. I know I've seen the Midori notebook on countless occasions during other web surfing sessions, but I never paid attention to the Midori notebook <em>system</em>.</p>

<p>In effect, the Midori Traveler's Notebook is far more than a simple leather cover for your notebooks. Instead, using a fairly simple elastic chord system, the Midori Traveler's Notebook is capable of accumulating many different notebooks, planners, storage pockets and trinkets into a brilliantly customized leather case. If you want to get a great idea of how a Midori works, you should head over to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUbokv1HzQ">Goulet Pens' awesome video review</a> of the passport-sized Midori. </p>

<p>I think I disregarded the Midori on past occasions because it doesn't appear pocketable whatsoever. I have always valued a notebook that can be carried on my person and, therefore, the Midori just didn't fit me.</p>

<p>But I've started to carry a bag around recently. And, as a result, the Midori looks more and more appealing. My favourite <a href="http://tinyfeast.com">stationery shop</a> will be offering some Midori Notebooks very shortly. You can bet I'll grab one as soon as I get back there.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I highly recommend you check out Patrick Ng's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?w=80919450@N00&amp;q=%23travelersnotebook">incredible Flickr stream</a> of his Midori. The man is a pure artist, both with a camera and with his intricate artwork. His Midori stands as a great example of the potential of a Midori Notebook and I would love to have a customized notebook with sentimental odds and ends.</p>

<p>And if you want more Midori goodness, here's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/travelernotebook/">a link</a> to a more generalized Flickr stream of the beautiful notebook. </p>
