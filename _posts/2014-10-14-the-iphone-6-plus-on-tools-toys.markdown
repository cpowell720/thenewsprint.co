I'm not sure if there was ever a secret to be kept, but I can finally announce that I've been working with Shawn Blanc and his team at Tools & Toys over the past few weeks. Today, we published a review of the new iPhone 6 Plus. The review has a ton of photos and some of my personal thoughts as well. 

I love the way the new Tools & Toys design makes the photographs pop and come to life. Tools & Toys is now meant for awesome photo reviews and I'm so excited to be a part of it.

It's been a pile of fun to work with Shawn and Co. over the past few weeks. I can't wait to show off what's next.
