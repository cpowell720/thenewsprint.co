I’ve followed Dan Hawk for quite some time. I am continually amazed by the photos he churns out — Dan’s [365 Project](http://danhawk.com/danhawk/) is one of the best I’ve come across. He finds ways to make the mundane dazzle with the right colour and the right amount of pop.

Dan recently penned a great guide to learning the basics of manual controls. He puts many of the technical aspects into ordinary English and the guide helps make photography more approachable.

If you want to learn the basics, Dan’s guide should be your first stop.
