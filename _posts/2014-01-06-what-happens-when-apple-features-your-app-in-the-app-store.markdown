<p>Although this may seem obvious to some, I always wondered how developers intended to generate revenue from a normally paid app going free. As Paul Mayne, founder of <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>, explains, increased brand awareness should increase the chance of an effective paid upgrade.</p>
