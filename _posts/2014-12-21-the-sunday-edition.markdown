'Twas the Sunday before Christmas. 

It may be a bit quieter around here over the next seven days. Christmas has become far less about celebration and far more about rest, rejuvenation, sharing smiles, and passing on the joy of the season. This has hit home this year more so than any year before — we have spent next to nothing on Christmas gifts. I like it this way. Christmas is far more Christmas when gift-giving isn't involved and when R&R is the only task on the to-do list. 

So, with that in mind, I plan on grabbing a glass of my favourite scotch sometime during the week and enjoying it with my family and close friends. If you feel like doing the same, don't forget to do some reading while you're at it.
