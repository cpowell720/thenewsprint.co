I've dreamed about traveling to Iceland. 

After watching this, I'm tired of dreaming. It's time to make this a reality. 

Alex Cornell's videos are [fantastic](http://vimeo.com/94579777) and often offer a peculiar storyline to accompany the beautiful backdrops. If you want to catch a glimpse of his equally impressive photography, head over to Nikki Desuasido's (Alex's friend) [blog.](http://hellonikki.net)
