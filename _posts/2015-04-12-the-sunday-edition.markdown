After a long week of work, I was able to dust off my camera yesterday and snap a few photos. What a breath of fresh air. Thanks for sticking with me.

A little plug this Sunday morning: If you enjoy The Sunday Edition, I recommend checking out the [Tools & Toys Quality Linkage post](http://toolsandtoys.net/editorials/deep-notes-otherwordly-oceans-and-year-long-travel-sabbaticals/) every Friday morning. I find a good chunk of my weekly links from the Quality Linkage article and I leave out a few incredible reads each week.
