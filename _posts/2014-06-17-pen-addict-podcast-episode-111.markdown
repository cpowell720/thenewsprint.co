**The** [Brad Dowdy](http://penaddict.com) and **The** [Myke Hurley](http://mykehurley.net) were gracious enough to have me as a guest on the [Pen Addict Podcast](http://5by5.tv/penaddict/111) this week. We talked about all things [Field Notes Arts and Sciences](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/06/16/field-notes-arts-and-sciences/) and we indulged in our obsession just a bit further.

It's not every day that I get to talk to people who love analog tools the way Brad and Myke do. They were a ton of fun to chat with and I recommend you check out the episode. At the end of the day, indulging in a Field Notes obsession is probably a little healthier than some others might think.
