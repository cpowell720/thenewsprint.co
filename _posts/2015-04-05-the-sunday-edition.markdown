I love Easter Weekend. It’s like Christmas without the gifts.

There’s a lot to consume in this Sunday Edition. If you don’t find time to give these reads a look, I don’t blame you. I know I won’t have any time for it myself. 

However, if you find a lull during your family gathering, I’ve got you covered.
