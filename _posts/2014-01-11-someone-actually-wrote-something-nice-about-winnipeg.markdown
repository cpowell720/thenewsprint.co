<p>Ironically, you can't find any positive writing about Winnipeg in Canada, or the United States, or Mexico, or even in South America.</p>

<p>Nope, you have to go all the way to Australia to find a publication wild enough to write something nice about Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Turns out it's pretty well written too.</p>
